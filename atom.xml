Videos are chosen by a significant majority of people on all social media platforms. But why is this the case?</p><p>Consumers favor videos because they are simple to consume, grasp, and comprehend. In contrast, video producers prefer videos because they know that their content is available to everyone with an internet connection.</p><p>Twitter also keeps up with the times. In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a ‘renowned’ Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.</p><p>To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 <strong>Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</strong>. Let’s dive in.</p><h2 id="What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’"><a href="#What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’" class="headerlink" title="What is ‘Most Viewed?’"></a>What is ‘Most Viewed?’</h2><p>Even though this is hardly rocket science for many, some people continue to conflate the terms’ most watched’ and ‘viral.’ So, what is it that distinguishes the worlds of the two? It’s as easy as the number of views!</p><p>When a video is deemed the ‘most viewed,’ it means that it is currently leading the pack in terms of the number of people who have seen it compared to all other videos on the platform.</p><h2 id="10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter"></a>10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</h2><h3 id="1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz"><a href="#1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz" class="headerlink" title="1. Messi’s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz"></a>1. <strong>Messi’s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz</strong></h3><p>This is the most viewed twitter video of 2022. This video’s caption says, “Lionel still needs to explain how he did this.” This video was posted on January 25, 2022, with around 4.7M views in just two days. This video features Filipe Luiz of Atletico de Madrid getting nutmegged by Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona. Nutmeg is the term used when a ball goes through the legs of the player. It is considered one of the most humiliating things in football for an opponent player.</p><p>Lionel Messi, an Argentinian International, is regarded as one of the best players the footballing world has ever seen. He is a seven times Ballon D’or and a six times FIFA THE BEST award winner. Messi was an integral part of FC Barcelona’s glory period.</p><p>Now, getting back to the video, in the video, Messi is seen nutmegging the Atletico de Madrid’s left-back by the body faint, which was never seen before in football history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-1.png"                      alt="Messi&#39;s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1166360/14483" target="_top" id="1166360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1166360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1166360/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-A-Metaverse-Prison-Yard-Virtual-Video-By-Elon-Musk"><a href="#2-A-Metaverse-Prison-Yard-Virtual-Video-By-Elon-Musk" class="headerlink" title="2. **A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"></a>2. **<strong>A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk</strong></h3><p>Well, Elon Musk needs no introduction. Still, for those who don’t know the man, Elon Musk is a flamboyant entrepreneur best known as the co-founder of PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA) and the creator of SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, among other ventures. He happens to have tweeted one of the most viewed Twitter videos in 2022.</p><p>He now works as the CEO of Tesla and the CEO and chief designer of SpaceX. He is expected to have a total net worth of $151 billion by 2022. Only Jeff Bezos comes close to him in terms of wealth as the world’s wealthiest person. The rest, you can figure out…</p><p>As for the video, which has gathered a total of 4.6M on Twitter, it says: “me fighting in the metaverse prison yard where I’m doing time for screenshotting nfts.”</p><p>NFTs and Metaverse, we are stepping into a virtual world, aren’t we?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-2.png"                      alt="Video of A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148646/16836" target="_top" id="2148646">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148646" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148646/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX"><a href="#3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX" class="headerlink" title="3. **Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX"></a>3. **<strong>Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX</strong></h3><p>SpaceX’s Falcon 9 medium-lift launch system is a partly reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift spacecraft developed and constructed in the United States. The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.</p><p>As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.</p><p>And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9’s first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.</p><p>Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-3.png"                      alt="A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><h3 id="4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer"><a href="#4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="4. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"></a>4. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer</h3><p>The caption of this twitter video reads, “this season on #EUPHORIA…”. This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy. On December 9, 2021, he tweeted a video that only lasts 58 seconds but has received more than 2M views as the world prepares to enter 2022.</p><p>Bill said, I remain hopeful about the prospects for accelerated innovation in the climate field. I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-5.png"                      alt="Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"                ></p><h3 id="6-Neymar’s-Dribbling"><a href="#6-Neymar’s-Dribbling" class="headerlink" title="6. Neymar’s Dribbling"></a>6. <strong>Neymar’s Dribbling</strong></h3><p>The title of this Twitter video is “Just Neymar.” It is posted from the official Twitter account of the UEFA Champions League, which is considered the biggest club football tournament in Europe. The video was posted on January 25, 2022, and gathered around 1.6M views in just 24 hours.</p><p>On February 5, 1992, he was born in Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil, as Neymar. Neymar is widely considered one of the most talented players of his time.</p><p>The flexible attacker is most effective on the left-wing, although he can also play on the right side and as an attacker or second striker. The Brazilian has 202 club goals in 346 matches and 53 international goals in 83 outings.</p><p>This video is basically about Neymar dribbling in the opposition’s half for fun. Neymar is regarded as one of the best dribblers of this generation of football players. The idea of posting this video was to tell the viewers how good Neymar is when it comes to dribbling and how you just have to sit back and enjoy when he is on the ball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-6.png"                      alt="Neymar&#39;s Dribbling"                ></p><h3 id="7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets"><a href="#7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets" class="headerlink" title="7. Virat Kohli Practicing in Nets"></a>7. <strong>Virat Kohli Practicing in Nets</strong></h3><p>The caption of this Twitter video says, “The bat sound of @iamVkohli #Virat #Cricket #ViratKohli.” The video was posted on January 24, 2022, and has around 1.5M views in just two days, which is astonishing.</p><p>The video features Virat Kohli, an Indian Men’s National and Royal Challengers Bangalore Cricket Team player, the former captain of the Indian National Team. Virat Kohli is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and arguably the greatest. He is undoubtedly the best batsman of this cricketing generation.</p><p>Virat has 71 international tons under his belt, only second to the great Sachin Tendulkar. Virat is also considered among the most exemplary leaders in the history of Cricket. He has hundreds of records in his feather to date.</p><p>Now talking about the video, the sound when the ball is hitting his bat and how he is timing the ball even in the nets is mesmerizing for every cricket fan. It depicts the hard work and dedication he puts in his work. Moreover, he is idolized worldwide for what he has achieved as a batsman and Indian Cricket Team’s captain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-7.png"                      alt="Virat Kohli Practicing in Nets"                ></p><h3 id="8-Ozark-Season-4-Part-1-Trailer"><a href="#8-Ozark-Season-4-Part-1-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="8.

This video was posted on January 10, 2022 and has around 1.2M views to date. Ozark is an official Netflix TV series that debuted in 2013.</p><p>It is a crime television drama written by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams and created by MRC. A financial planner brings his household from Chicago to the Missouri Ozarks to hide money for a drug lord. The Byrdes and their teenage children, Charlotte and Jonah, are, for the most part, an average family living an ordinary life.</p><p>In the teaser, Marty, and Wendy attempt to negotiate an immunity agreement between Navarro and the FBI. Marty’s conflict with Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) worsens. The last season has 14 episodes, divided into two parts of seven each. Part 1 of Ozark will be available on Netflix on January 21.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-8.png"                      alt="Ozark Season 4 Part 1 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="9-’AVE-IT-’-by-LADbible"><a href="#9-’AVE-IT-’-by-LADbible" class="headerlink" title="9. ****’AVE IT!’ by LADbible**"></a>9. ****’AVE IT!’ by LADbible**</h3><p>Are you ready to see some of the most popular humorous videos on the internet? Although we didn’t intend to include the “fun” genre on our list, we couldn’t help but include this one since we did not want to let this one slip between the cracks.</p><p>We think it’s pretty amusing. That might not be the case for you if you were in the position of the bald man who had his face smacked with the ball kicked by the small youngster standing next to him. While this may sound hazardous or unpleasant, we promise you will have a good chuckle and come away with a different point of view after watching it.</p><p>The video was shared on Twitter today by the LADbible’s account, and it seems to have been seen by as many as 1 million people thus far. That was lightning-fast. And you can pretty much guarantee that this video will continue to gain popularity and get another couple of million views in no time!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-9.png"                      alt="&#39;AVE IT!&#39; by LADbible"                ></p><h3 id="10-Ronaldo-Playing-Football-with-A-Boy-Without-Legs"><a href="#10-Ronaldo-Playing-Football-with-A-Boy-Without-Legs" class="headerlink" title="10.

He has previously played for Sporting Club de Portugal (Portugal), Real Madrid (Spain), and Juventus (Italy). Ronaldo also has the most international goals in the history of football.

While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-5.png"                      alt="Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"                ></p><h3 id="6-Neymar’s-Dribbling-3"><a href="#6-Neymar’s-Dribbling-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

But, that utilizes the auto-share feature that automatically shares everything you post on Twitter to all your other social media. But nobody really wants to do that.</p><p>That’s why we are here to teach you to the manual method of sharing videos and how you can post a video from Twitter to Facebook. This way, you can share all your favorite tweets and videos from Twitter to Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h2><p>There are multiple ways to post your Twitter videos on your Facebook account without linking the accounts together. We have listed three ways to do that. So, let’s begin:</p><h3 id="1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h3><p>While scrolling through your Twitter feed, if you encounter a fascinating video and want to share it with your Facebook friends, then follow the steps below. The only way to share a video manually from Twitter to Facebook is by copying the link of the video.</p><p>If you have not used this method before, do not worry. We will guide you through it.</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure you have the Twitter video opened in front of you, and you have also logged into your Facebook account.</li><li>Now open the video you want to share and from the upper right corner, click on the downward-facing arrow.</li><li>This will show you three options “<strong>Copy Link To Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>Embed Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>I Don’t like this Tweet</strong>”. Select “<strong>Copy Link to Tweet</strong>”.</li><li>Now a window will open showing the link of the Tweet. You can select the link and copy it.</li><li>Next, open your Facebook page, and from the newsfeed area, <strong>Create a New Post</strong>.</li><li>Post the link of the video in the “<strong>Create a New Post Area</strong>” Once you paste the link, Facebook will find the video and load it to your post. You can preview it too before posting.</li><li>You can also type in a caption for the video and just click post to post your video.</li></ul><p>This is the easiest and most direct way to post a video from Twitter to Facebook. However, if you do not want to use the direct method for some reason, there are multiple indirect methods to post Twitter videos to Facebook.</p><h3 id="2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website"><a href="#2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website" class="headerlink" title="2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website"></a>2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website</h3><p>There are multiple sites on the internet that can help you download a Twitter video and then post it. Given below are two websites you can use to download videos. So, let’s dive in:</p><ul><li>Log into your Twitter account and open your Newsfeed on your PC.</li><li>Locate the video you want to share on Facebook. If you found the video in your newsfeed, you can look for it there.</li><li>In case you retweeted the video, you can find the video on your profile. Click on the Profile symbol, and from the dropdown menu, select Profile. Now click on the Media tab from the top of your profile and look for the video.</li><li>Once you find the video, open it and click on Play to start playing the video.</li><li>Right-click on the video next, and from the menu, select Copy Video Address. This will copy the link for the video so you can paste it wherever you want.</li><li>Now open another tab in your browser and open the <a class="link"   href="https://twdown.net/in" >TwDown <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> This website allows you to download Twitter videos and recordings easily.</li><li>Once you open the website, click on the URL textbox and paste the link you copied.</li><li>Wait for the website to find the video and load it. Once loaded, you can download it by clicking on Download Link.</li><li>This will open your video in a new tab, and you can click on the Download symbol to Download the video.</li><li>Once the video is downloaded, you can post it to Facebook.</li><li>Log into your Facebook account and open your Newsfeed. You will find the Create a New Post Text Box on the top.</li><li>Click on the Add a Video icon to add a new video.</li><li>Locate the video on your PC and click Open to add it to your post.</li><li>Now, write an appropriate caption to match your video and click on Post.</li></ul><p>And voila!

Download a Twitter Video with the sssTwitter website and Post it on Facebook"></a>3. Download a Twitter Video with the sssTwitter website and Post it on Facebook</h3><p>Another way to download and post a video from Twitter to Facebook is using the sssTwitter website. Here is how you can download and post the video:</p><ul><li>Now log into your Twitter account and find the video you want to share on Facebook.</li><li>Make sure you do not tap on the video and only snap the tweet to grow it.</li><li>In the URL box on top of your tab, carefully edit your URL address. Add “sss” before Twitter. For example, if it looked like “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/%5Blink" >https://twitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]” before, make sure it looks like “<a class="link"   href="https://ssstwitter.com/%5Blink" >https://ssstwitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]”</li><li>Now Press Enter. This will take you directly to the sssTwitter website, which will allow you to download the video.</li><li>You will encounter several Download links. By clicking on them, you will see multiple video quality options. Right-click on the video link of your favored quality and select Save As.</li><li>Give your video a name and choose the location, and press Save to start the download.</li><li>Once the video is downloaded, the next step is posting it to Facebook.</li><li>Open your Facebook app or log on to Facebook from the Web.</li><li>Go to the Newsfeed screen, and on the top, you will find the Create a new Post Text Box.</li><li>Click on add a video to add the video from your PC. Locate the file and wait for it to upload.</li><li>Add an appropriate caption to match the video and click on Post.</li></ul><p>And you have now successfully posted a video from Twitter to Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-Post-Tweets-on-Facebook"><a href="#How-to-Post-Tweets-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How to Post Tweets on Facebook"></a>How to Post Tweets on Facebook</h2><p>Guide every step with good images.</p><p>If you are running a business or an e-commerce store, then posting the same content across various social media platforms can be very important.

But, that utilizes the auto-share feature that automatically shares everything you post on Twitter to all your other social media. But nobody really wants to do that.</p><p>That’s why we are here to teach you to the manual method of sharing videos and how you can post a video from Twitter to Facebook.

Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h3><p>While scrolling through your Twitter feed, if you encounter a fascinating video and want to share it with your Facebook friends, then follow the steps below. The only way to share a video manually from Twitter to Facebook is by copying the link of the video.</p><p>If you have not used this method before, do not worry. We will guide you through it.</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure you have the Twitter video opened in front of you, and you have also logged into your Facebook account.</li><li>Now open the video you want to share and from the upper right corner, click on the downward-facing arrow.</li><li>This will show you three options “<strong>Copy Link To Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>Embed Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>I Don’t like this Tweet</strong>”. Select “<strong>Copy Link to Tweet</strong>”.</li><li>Now a window will open showing the link of the Tweet. You can select the link and copy it.</li><li>Next, open your Facebook page, and from the newsfeed area, <strong>Create a New Post</strong>.</li><li>Post the link of the video in the “<strong>Create a New Post Area</strong>” Once you paste the link, Facebook will find the video and load it to your post. You can preview it too before posting.</li><li>You can also type in a caption for the video and just click post to post your video.</li></ul><p>This is the easiest and most direct way to post a video from Twitter to Facebook. However, if you do not want to use the direct method for some reason, there are multiple indirect methods to post Twitter videos to Facebook.</p><h3 id="2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website-1"><a href="#2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7. Video bitrate limit on Twitter</strong></p><p>Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter"><a href="#Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Specifications for Twitter"></a>Best Video Specifications for Twitter</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Best Format Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1280x720, 720x1280, 720x720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 or 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Minimum)</strong></td><td>5000 kbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Maximum)</strong></td><td>128 kbps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With video consumption increasing year after year, Twitter video helps you to remain current and attract an audience that values video content for knowledge. Purchase intent rises by 34% when videos are shared on Twitter. In truth, Twitter is about far more than 280 characters: it’s about telling a narrative, your story.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?"></a>Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?</h2><p>Both Twitter In-feed videos and Twitter video advertising have comparable video specs, which is fortunate for you. However, we’ll still go through the Twitter video criteria for each of them, as well as some best practices for increasing interaction. It’s critical to understand the proper Twitter video specifications, such as the maximum size limit, format, and aspect ratios. By keeping an eye out for things like these, you can guarantee <strong>how to post videos on Twitter</strong> in the best possible form for a better watching experience.</p><ul><li>Never exceed a frame of 30 frames per second. Although Twitter can accept files with a frame rate of 40 frames per second, limiting your video to 30 frames per second will ensure cross-channel compatibility.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006960/19272" target="_top" id="2006960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC"><a href="#1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC" class="headerlink" title="1.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7. Video bitrate limit on Twitter</strong></p><p>Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Specifications for Twitter"></a>Best Video Specifications for Twitter</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Best Format Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1280x720, 720x1280, 720x720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 or 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Minimum)</strong></td><td>5000 kbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Maximum)</strong></td><td>128 kbps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With video consumption increasing year after year, Twitter video helps you to remain current and attract an audience that values video content for knowledge. Purchase intent rises by 34% when videos are shared on Twitter. In truth, Twitter is about far more than 280 characters: it’s about telling a narrative, your story.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, we’ll still go through the Twitter video criteria for each of them, as well as some best practices for increasing interaction. It’s critical to understand the proper Twitter video specifications, such as the maximum size limit, format, and aspect ratios. By keeping an eye out for things like these, you can guarantee <strong>how to post videos on Twitter</strong> in the best possible form for a better watching experience.</p><ul><li>Never exceed a frame of 30 frames per second. Although Twitter can accept files with a frame rate of 40 frames per second, limiting your video to 30 frames per second will ensure cross-channel compatibility.</li></ul><h2 id="1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC-3"><a href="#1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Twesocial reviews would be fascinating to read in this respect. Since it was released to the public, everybody has gone wild for it. It did, however, happen gradually.</p><p>Twitter was founded in 2006, and by 2012, over 100 million users were sending around 340 million tweets every day. Twitter had the most following celebrities back in the day, with some net earnings of $1.13 billion.</p><p>You can also post media (pictures and videos) on Twitter without difficulty. Along with the tweets, videos and pictures also go viral with each passing day. Since several videos are posted every day, it’s hard to guess which one is viral these days.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what makes a viral <strong>Twitter video hot</strong>? Twitter’s hype has been boosted every day from its inception for various reasons. One of the numerous things we could question about Twitter is what are the most popular viral Twitter videos. To help you solve that question, we’ve compiled a list of the Top 10 Hot and Viral Videos on Twitter in this article. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-is-Viral-Video"><a href="#What-is-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Viral Video?"></a>What is Viral Video?</h2><p>A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.</p><p>Tweets may become viral for a variety of reasons. They might increase awareness of a problem, create arguments, or even be amusing. But what’s common in them is that they attract the users and the influencers to give their views about them.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips"><a href="#Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips"></a>Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips</h2><p>Viral videos are hard to find on other social sites, but Twitter, an open platform for all users, provides easy access to viral or trendy clips. This quality of Twitter makes it stand out from other social platforms. It helps the user find trendy fashion, sports, cooking, Hollywood, etc., with mere clicks. The following are the top 10 viral hot clips Twitter:</p><h2 id="1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look"><a href="#1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look" class="headerlink" title="1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look"></a>1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look</h2><p>This video reads, “me after seeing Billie’s pictures: #BillieEilish #BillieEilishHotWhile,” which refers to all of us. Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel" class="headerlink" title="2. Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"></a>2. <strong>Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel</strong></h3><p>This video has the caption “Lil Nas X representing the fallen angel Satan.” It was posted on May 27, 2021. However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3. Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"></a>3. <strong>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating</strong></h3><p>The title for this video hot on Twitter reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.” This video has 572K views, and it was posted on November 19, 2021.</p><p>It displays Paul Rudd laughing and replying “Not me” to the interviewer’s question, “Look at us, who would have thought?”, clearly demonstrating the fan’s feelings after hearing the news that Pete and Kim Kardashian, days after Kanye and Kim broke up.</p><p>The title for this viral Twitter video reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.”</p><p>Kim Kardashian’s divorce from Kanye West was possibly this year’s most unexpected yet unsurprising occurrence in popular culture history. According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty" class="headerlink" title="4. Children Being Naughty"></a>4. <strong>Children Being Naughty</strong></h3><p>The hot viral Twitter clip has the caption saying, “Even more reasons not to have kids.” It was uploaded on January 24, 2022, by the well-known Twitter account @LADBible. LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious. In this video, children are doing crazy stuff, such as throwing stuff at the TV, breading the father’s nose, breaking glasses, throwing cereal on the couch, punching their father in serious areas, etc. Moreover, the video has around 622K views on Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-4.png"                      alt="Children Being Naughty"                ></p><h3 id="5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues"><a href="#5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues" class="headerlink" title="5. Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues"></a>5. <strong>Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues</strong></h3><p>“Simone Biles has withdrawn from the vault and poles finals,” Justin Lee said in the video. “I believe now is a perfect time to offer Auburn trainer Jeff Graba’s description of Biles’ problems.” Everyone who has ever been a gymnast knows that when the twisties are mentioned, everyone comes to a halt. It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died" class="headerlink" title="6. Mr. Big Died"></a>6. <strong>Mr. Big Died</strong></h3><p>The title for this video’s hot viral Twitter reads, “WTF #AndJustLikeThat Mr. Big is no longer alive. I assumed he was having a stroke and wondered why Carrie didn’t call for an ambulance…”.</p><p>This video was posted on December 9, 2021, with around 200K views. In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals" class="headerlink" title="7. Kit Harrington Won’t Eat His Cereals"></a>7. <strong>Kit Harrington Won’t Eat His Cereals</strong></h3><p>This viral Twitter video is titled “In loving remembrance of the “Ryan Gosling won’t eat his cereal” vines.” This video was posted on May 26, 2019, from an account named Eugene Buenaventura, and it has around 1.4M Twitter views to date. In this video, Kit Harrington, known for playing John Snow in the popular TV series Game of Thrones, is offered something to eat that he is not eating.</p><p>Following a succession of six-second footage of A-list actor Ryan Gosling being fed a spoonful of breakfast cereal, this clip took its artistic expression as a famous culture treasure on Vine. The video’s caption assured that it swiftly became viral, mirroring the internet trajectory of a significant breakthrough news item.</p><p>The popularity of the Gosling viral demonstrates the importance of strategically seeding your material with the key influencers and how, in some situations, a small number of people may go worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-7.png"                      alt="Video about Kit Harrington Won&#39;t Eat His Cereals"                ></p><h3 id="8-Dove-Brand-Campaign"><a href="#8-Dove-Brand-Campaign" class="headerlink" title="8.

More on the stereotype-busting spot can be seen on @CampaignLiveUS “. It was posted on November 09, 2019, and has around 4K views to the date.</p><p>The film for Dove’s Real Beauty Sketches #WeAreBeautiful ad traveled unlike any other, thanks to a long tail of connection and strong audience reaction.</p><p>This video has shown less fatigue than the others and fewer influencer-induced spikes. Instead, the dialogue took place in clusters of towns scattered over the world, demonstrating the importance of local interaction and highlighting the practical usage of a digital outreach campaign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-8.png"                      alt="Video about Dove Brand Campaign"                ></p><h3 id="9-Cats-Defying-Laws-of-Physics"><a href="#9-Cats-Defying-Laws-of-Physics" class="headerlink" title="9. Cats Defying Laws of Physics"></a>9. <strong>Cats Defying Laws of Physics</strong></h3><p>This hot video on Twitter has the caption, “Cats defying all laws of physics.” On January 24, 2022, it was posted by a famous Twitter account named <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/ladbible/status/1485553202607108096" >@LADBible <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. LADBible has been famous for posting trendy twitter videos to entertain its followers for a long time. Moreover, this Twitter account has many followers (around 2.9M), including some celebrities.</p><p>Although the caption of the video seems a bit cheesy to you at first, you would be amazed and wonder how those cats are doing that stuff when you see the video. In the video, cats are going under the locked door, running on vertical walls, walking under the bed upside down, jumping up to the room’s roof, coming out of a thing cage, etc., which is not exactly typical for a cat do. Furthermore, this video has 270K views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-9.png"                      alt="Cats Defying Laws of Physics"                ></p><h3 id="10-Man-Eating-His-Phone"><a href="#10-Man-Eating-His-Phone" class="headerlink" title="10.

This video was posted on January 24, 2021, with around 688K views.</p><p>After reading the caption, you won’t get the idea of what it is about, so we recommend watching it. However, if you’re too lazy for that, keep reading. It is a 24-second clip featuring a sleeping guy who has a pizza slice in one hand and his phone in the other. After he wakes up, he starts eating his phone instead of the pizza, which looks funny and a bit embarrassing for the man, who just got captured while doing that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-10.png"                      alt="Viral video of a Man Eating His Phone"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to Go Viral on Twitter"></a>How to Go Viral on Twitter</h2><p>With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it’s quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1.

However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked.

It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died-2"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-2"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136623/26400" target="_top" id="2136623">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136623" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136623/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating-3"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson.

LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious. In this video, children are doing crazy stuff, such as throwing stuff at the TV, breading the father’s nose, breaking glasses, throwing cereal on the couch, punching their father in serious areas, etc. Moreover, the video has around 622K views on Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-4.png"                      alt="Children Being Naughty"                ></p><h3 id="5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues-3"><a href="#5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died-3"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

I assumed he was having a stroke and wondered why Carrie didn’t call for an ambulance…”.</p><p>This video was posted on December 9, 2021, with around 200K views. In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

In this video, Kit Harrington, known for playing John Snow in the popular TV series Game of Thrones, is offered something to eat that he is not eating.</p><p>Following a succession of six-second footage of A-list actor Ryan Gosling being fed a spoonful of breakfast cereal, this clip took its artistic expression as a famous culture treasure on Vine. The video’s caption assured that it swiftly became viral, mirroring the internet trajectory of a significant breakthrough news item.</p><p>The popularity of the Gosling viral demonstrates the importance of strategically seeding your material with the key influencers and how, in some situations, a small number of people may go worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-7.png"                      alt="Video about Kit Harrington Won&#39;t Eat His Cereals"                ></p><h3 id="8-Dove-Brand-Campaign-3"><a href="#8-Dove-Brand-Campaign-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

LADBible has been famous for posting trendy twitter videos to entertain its followers for a long time. Moreover, this Twitter account has many followers (around 2.9M), including some celebrities.</p><p>Although the caption of the video seems a bit cheesy to you at first, you would be amazed and wonder how those cats are doing that stuff when you see the video. In the video, cats are going under the locked door, running on vertical walls, walking under the bed upside down, jumping up to the room’s roof, coming out of a thing cage, etc., which is not exactly typical for a cat do. Furthermore, this video has 270K views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-9.png"                      alt="Cats Defying Laws of Physics"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049369/7443" target="_top" id="2049369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049369/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Man-Eating-His-Phone-3"><a href="#10-Man-Eating-His-Phone-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

It is yet another video posted from the LADBible, a famous page on Twitter that pots trendy and viral videos to entertain its followers and let them have a good time on Twitter. This video was posted on January 24, 2021, with around 688K views.</p><p>After reading the caption, you won’t get the idea of what it is about, so we recommend watching it. However, if you’re too lazy for that, keep reading. It is a 24-second clip featuring a sleeping guy who has a pizza slice in one hand and his phone in the other. After he wakes up, he starts eating his phone instead of the pizza, which looks funny and a bit embarrassing for the man, who just got captured while doing that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-10.png"                      alt="Viral video of a Man Eating His Phone"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Go Viral on Twitter"></a>How to Go Viral on Twitter</h2><p>With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it’s quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-3"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-3"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel. Learning what the viral <strong>Twitter video hot</strong> is intriguing for someone who is constantly interested in what is on-trend these days.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-videotweeteraudio-quick-audio-extractor/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved VideoTweeterAudio Quick Audio Extractor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-unleash-funimate-with-apk-on-your-phone/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How to Unleash Funimate with APK on Your Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-social-sphere-shift-identifying-the-days-hottest-tweets-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Social Sphere Shift Identifying the Day's Hottest Tweets for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-2023-techniques-sending-tweets-as-videos-to-whatsapp/"><u>2024 Approved 2023 Techniques Sending Tweets as Videos to WhatsApp</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-hidefake-snapchat-location-on-your-infinix-note-30-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Infinix Note 30 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-9-motorola-moto-g04-monitoring-apps-for-parental-controls-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 9 Motorola Moto G04 Monitoring Apps for Parental Controls | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-the-repair-speedy-techniques-to-overcome-madden-22-errors/"><u>Mastering the Repair: Speedy Techniques to Overcome Madden 22 Errors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/overcoming-the-noise-barrier-twitter-vids-without-sounds-for-2024/"><u>Overcoming the Noise Barrier Twitter Vids Without Sounds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-realme-11x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Realme 11X 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-guide-resolved-realtek-high-quality-sound-connection-issue/"><u>Troubleshooting Guide - Resolved: Realtek High-Quality Sound Connection Issue</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform.

You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording.

But, that utilizes the auto-share feature that automatically shares everything you post on Twitter to all your other social media. But nobody really wants to do that.</p><p>That’s why we are here to teach you to the manual method of sharing videos and how you can post a video from Twitter to Facebook. This way, you can share all your favorite tweets and videos from Twitter to Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h2><p>There are multiple ways to post your Twitter videos on your Facebook account without linking the accounts together. We have listed three ways to do that. So, let’s begin:</p><h3 id="1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h3><p>While scrolling through your Twitter feed, if you encounter a fascinating video and want to share it with your Facebook friends, then follow the steps below. The only way to share a video manually from Twitter to Facebook is by copying the link of the video.</p><p>If you have not used this method before, do not worry. We will guide you through it.</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure you have the Twitter video opened in front of you, and you have also logged into your Facebook account.</li><li>Now open the video you want to share and from the upper right corner, click on the downward-facing arrow.</li><li>This will show you three options “<strong>Copy Link To Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>Embed Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>I Don’t like this Tweet</strong>”. Select “<strong>Copy Link to Tweet</strong>”.</li><li>Now a window will open showing the link of the Tweet. You can select the link and copy it.</li><li>Next, open your Facebook page, and from the newsfeed area, <strong>Create a New Post</strong>.</li><li>Post the link of the video in the “<strong>Create a New Post Area</strong>” Once you paste the link, Facebook will find the video and load it to your post. You can preview it too before posting.</li><li>You can also type in a caption for the video and just click post to post your video.</li></ul><p>This is the easiest and most direct way to post a video from Twitter to Facebook. However, if you do not want to use the direct method for some reason, there are multiple indirect methods to post Twitter videos to Facebook.</p><h3 id="2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website"><a href="#2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website" class="headerlink" title="2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website"></a>2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website</h3><p>There are multiple sites on the internet that can help you download a Twitter video and then post it. Given below are two websites you can use to download videos. So, let’s dive in:</p><ul><li>Log into your Twitter account and open your Newsfeed on your PC.</li><li>Locate the video you want to share on Facebook. If you found the video in your newsfeed, you can look for it there.</li><li>In case you retweeted the video, you can find the video on your profile. Click on the Profile symbol, and from the dropdown menu, select Profile. Now click on the Media tab from the top of your profile and look for the video.</li><li>Once you find the video, open it and click on Play to start playing the video.</li><li>Right-click on the video next, and from the menu, select Copy Video Address. This will copy the link for the video so you can paste it wherever you want.</li><li>Now open another tab in your browser and open the <a class="link"   href="https://twdown.net/in" >TwDown <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> This website allows you to download Twitter videos and recordings easily.</li><li>Once you open the website, click on the URL textbox and paste the link you copied.</li><li>Wait for the website to find the video and load it. Once loaded, you can download it by clicking on Download Link.</li><li>This will open your video in a new tab, and you can click on the Download symbol to Download the video.</li><li>Once the video is downloaded, you can post it to Facebook.</li><li>Log into your Facebook account and open your Newsfeed. You will find the Create a New Post Text Box on the top.</li><li>Click on the Add a Video icon to add a new video.</li><li>Locate the video on your PC and click Open to add it to your post.</li><li>Now, write an appropriate caption to match your video and click on Post.</li></ul><p>And voila! You have posted a Twitter video on Facebook seamlessly.</p><h3 id="3-Download-a-Twitter-Video-with-the-sssTwitter-website-and-Post-it-on-Facebook"><a href="#3-Download-a-Twitter-Video-with-the-sssTwitter-website-and-Post-it-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="3. Download a Twitter Video with the sssTwitter website and Post it on Facebook"></a>3. Download a Twitter Video with the sssTwitter website and Post it on Facebook</h3><p>Another way to download and post a video from Twitter to Facebook is using the sssTwitter website. Here is how you can download and post the video:</p><ul><li>Now log into your Twitter account and find the video you want to share on Facebook.</li><li>Make sure you do not tap on the video and only snap the tweet to grow it.</li><li>In the URL box on top of your tab, carefully edit your URL address. Add “sss” before Twitter. For example, if it looked like “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/%5Blink" >https://twitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]” before, make sure it looks like “<a class="link"   href="https://ssstwitter.com/%5Blink" >https://ssstwitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]”</li><li>Now Press Enter. This will take you directly to the sssTwitter website, which will allow you to download the video.</li><li>You will encounter several Download links. By clicking on them, you will see multiple video quality options. Right-click on the video link of your favored quality and select Save As.</li><li>Give your video a name and choose the location, and press Save to start the download.</li><li>Once the video is downloaded, the next step is posting it to Facebook.</li><li>Open your Facebook app or log on to Facebook from the Web.</li><li>Go to the Newsfeed screen, and on the top, you will find the Create a new Post Text Box.</li><li>Click on add a video to add the video from your PC. Locate the file and wait for it to upload.</li><li>Add an appropriate caption to match the video and click on Post.</li></ul><p>And you have now successfully posted a video from Twitter to Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-Post-Tweets-on-Facebook"><a href="#How-to-Post-Tweets-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How to Post Tweets on Facebook"></a>How to Post Tweets on Facebook</h2><p>Guide every step with good images.</p><p>If you are running a business or an e-commerce store, then posting the same content across various social media platforms can be very important.

We have listed three ways to do that. So, let’s begin:</p><h3 id="1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook-1"><a href="#1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h3><p>While scrolling through your Twitter feed, if you encounter a fascinating video and want to share it with your Facebook friends, then follow the steps below. The only way to share a video manually from Twitter to Facebook is by copying the link of the video.</p><p>If you have not used this method before, do not worry. We will guide you through it.</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure you have the Twitter video opened in front of you, and you have also logged into your Facebook account.</li><li>Now open the video you want to share and from the upper right corner, click on the downward-facing arrow.</li><li>This will show you three options “<strong>Copy Link To Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>Embed Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>I Don’t like this Tweet</strong>”. Select “<strong>Copy Link to Tweet</strong>”.</li><li>Now a window will open showing the link of the Tweet. You can select the link and copy it.</li><li>Next, open your Facebook page, and from the newsfeed area, <strong>Create a New Post</strong>.</li><li>Post the link of the video in the “<strong>Create a New Post Area</strong>” Once you paste the link, Facebook will find the video and load it to your post. You can preview it too before posting.</li><li>You can also type in a caption for the video and just click post to post your video.</li></ul><p>This is the easiest and most direct way to post a video from Twitter to Facebook. However, if you do not want to use the direct method for some reason, there are multiple indirect methods to post Twitter videos to Facebook.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424531%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424531/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website-1"><a href="#2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

Twesocial reviews would be fascinating to read in this respect. Since it was released to the public, everybody has gone wild for it. It did, however, happen gradually.</p><p>Twitter was founded in 2006, and by 2012, over 100 million users were sending around 340 million tweets every day. Twitter had the most following celebrities back in the day, with some net earnings of $1.13 billion.</p><p>You can also post media (pictures and videos) on Twitter without difficulty. Along with the tweets, videos and pictures also go viral with each passing day. Since several videos are posted every day, it’s hard to guess which one is viral these days.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what makes a viral <strong>Twitter video hot</strong>? Twitter’s hype has been boosted every day from its inception for various reasons. One of the numerous things we could question about Twitter is what are the most popular viral Twitter videos. To help you solve that question, we’ve compiled a list of the Top 10 Hot and Viral Videos on Twitter in this article. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-is-Viral-Video"><a href="#What-is-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Viral Video?"></a>What is Viral Video?</h2><p>A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.</p><p>Tweets may become viral for a variety of reasons. They might increase awareness of a problem, create arguments, or even be amusing. But what’s common in them is that they attract the users and the influencers to give their views about them.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips"><a href="#Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips"></a>Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips</h2><p>Viral videos are hard to find on other social sites, but Twitter, an open platform for all users, provides easy access to viral or trendy clips. This quality of Twitter makes it stand out from other social platforms. It helps the user find trendy fashion, sports, cooking, Hollywood, etc., with mere clicks. The following are the top 10 viral hot clips Twitter:</p><h2 id="1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look"><a href="#1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look" class="headerlink" title="1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look"></a>1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look</h2><p>This video reads, “me after seeing Billie’s pictures: #BillieEilish #BillieEilishHotWhile,” which refers to all of us. Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148636/16836" target="_top" id="2148636">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148636" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148636/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel" class="headerlink" title="2. Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"></a>2. <strong>Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel</strong></h3><p>This video has the caption “Lil Nas X representing the fallen angel Satan.” It was posted on May 27, 2021. However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3. Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"></a>3. <strong>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating</strong></h3><p>The title for this video hot on Twitter reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.” This video has 572K views, and it was posted on November 19, 2021.</p><p>It displays Paul Rudd laughing and replying “Not me” to the interviewer’s question, “Look at us, who would have thought?”, clearly demonstrating the fan’s feelings after hearing the news that Pete and Kim Kardashian, days after Kanye and Kim broke up.</p><p>The title for this viral Twitter video reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.”</p><p>Kim Kardashian’s divorce from Kanye West was possibly this year’s most unexpected yet unsurprising occurrence in popular culture history. According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty" class="headerlink" title="4. Children Being Naughty"></a>4. <strong>Children Being Naughty</strong></h3><p>The hot viral Twitter clip has the caption saying, “Even more reasons not to have kids.” It was uploaded on January 24, 2022, by the well-known Twitter account @LADBible. LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious. In this video, children are doing crazy stuff, such as throwing stuff at the TV, breading the father’s nose, breaking glasses, throwing cereal on the couch, punching their father in serious areas, etc. Moreover, the video has around 622K views on Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-4.png"                      alt="Children Being Naughty"                ></p><h3 id="5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues"><a href="#5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues" class="headerlink" title="5. Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues"></a>5. <strong>Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues</strong></h3><p>“Simone Biles has withdrawn from the vault and poles finals,” Justin Lee said in the video. “I believe now is a perfect time to offer Auburn trainer Jeff Graba’s description of Biles’ problems.” Everyone who has ever been a gymnast knows that when the twisties are mentioned, everyone comes to a halt. It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died" class="headerlink" title="6. Mr. Big Died"></a>6. <strong>Mr. Big Died</strong></h3><p>The title for this video’s hot viral Twitter reads, “WTF #AndJustLikeThat Mr. Big is no longer alive. I assumed he was having a stroke and wondered why Carrie didn’t call for an ambulance…”.</p><p>This video was posted on December 9, 2021, with around 200K views. In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals" class="headerlink" title="7. Kit Harrington Won’t Eat His Cereals"></a>7. <strong>Kit Harrington Won’t Eat His Cereals</strong></h3><p>This viral Twitter video is titled “In loving remembrance of the “Ryan Gosling won’t eat his cereal” vines.” This video was posted on May 26, 2019, from an account named Eugene Buenaventura, and it has around 1.4M Twitter views to date. In this video, Kit Harrington, known for playing John Snow in the popular TV series Game of Thrones, is offered something to eat that he is not eating.</p><p>Following a succession of six-second footage of A-list actor Ryan Gosling being fed a spoonful of breakfast cereal, this clip took its artistic expression as a famous culture treasure on Vine. The video’s caption assured that it swiftly became viral, mirroring the internet trajectory of a significant breakthrough news item.</p><p>The popularity of the Gosling viral demonstrates the importance of strategically seeding your material with the key influencers and how, in some situations, a small number of people may go worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-7.png"                      alt="Video about Kit Harrington Won&#39;t Eat His Cereals"                ></p><h3 id="8-Dove-Brand-Campaign"><a href="#8-Dove-Brand-Campaign" class="headerlink" title="8. Dove Brand Campaign"></a>8. <strong>Dove Brand Campaign</strong></h3><p>The tagline for this video reads, “Dove’s inaugural purpose-driven marketing puts an end to armpit worry.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material.

To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet.

However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating-3"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty-3"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious.

It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died-3"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ffunwhole.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1495277%2F17189'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1495277/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

However, if you’re too lazy for that, keep reading. It is a 24-second clip featuring a sleeping guy who has a pizza slice in one hand and his phone in the other. After he wakes up, he starts eating his phone instead of the pizza, which looks funny and a bit embarrassing for the man, who just got captured while doing that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-10.png"                      alt="Viral video of a Man Eating His Phone"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Go Viral on Twitter"></a>How to Go Viral on Twitter</h2><p>With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it’s quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-3"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105870/7443" target="_top" id="2105870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-3"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter.

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.</p><p>Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link</h2><p>People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features.

It explains the situation in Harran, the city where the game takes place. The game proper starts with a cut scene that shows you on a plane, about to parachute out. There’s no character creation here, although once you get a little further into the game, you’ll be able to pick your clothes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/P3rXmBBI1GdQfgi0vVT9xKcFw90=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-2-db5990d1f64341eaae79e22a71bb8f95.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship"><a href="#Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship"></a><strong>Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship</strong></h2><p> The initial cutscene starts with you on a plane, preparing to jump. Your name is Kyle Crane, and you’re an undercover operative. You’ll parachute to the earth while your boss explains your mission―to find a stolen file―but the second you hit the ground, things don’t go as planned. You’re attacked and forced to fire your weapon to scatter your attackers. Of course, in zombie-infested Harran, a gunshot is zombie bait. Suddenly they’re swarming toward you and things look very dire, until you’re rescued by a pair of strangers, a man and a woman. The man dies saving you but you and the woman escape. Her name is Jade, and she’ll play a big role throughout the story as you try to win her and her brother’s trust.</p><p>Harran is a whole different city at night.</p><p> You’re a spy sent in to infiltrate this group of survivors by the Global Relief Effort or GRE, but now that they’ve saved your life, you start to feel like you owe them. They’ll send you on missions to prove yourself, such as setting up traps for air raid supply drops or battling the hostile bandits that prowl Harran’s streets. Throughout the game, you balance accomplishing the GRE’s task with serving the best interest of this group of survivors you find yourself increasingly attached to.</p><p> This is a fairly linear game with regards to the plot. There’s a main storyline for you to follow, with some optional side quests that you can take or leave. The narrative does a decent job of building up the circumstances for Kyle feeling torn between his mission and these people, and you’ll learn more about the virus as you go, as well as Antizin, the fictional drug that could lead to a cure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8G35q3VsoSEuht_3bqsGm0Pwz-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-7-d9d2bbe8881e476f8dfb3c13059634ed.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135400/19272" target="_top" id="2135400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135400/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925473/19272" target="_top" id="1925473">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925473" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925473/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore"><a href="#Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore"></a><strong>Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore</strong></h2><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour. Other zombie games focus on having slow zombies you can run away from, or dumb zombies you sneak past, but Dying Light takes a completely different approach. Instead, the basic zombies are fast and almost always know where you are―but they can’t climb or jump. This means you can stay safe by leaping between rooftops, running up ramps, balancing across bars, etc. The parkour feature is the biggest thing that makes Dying Light unique in an oversaturated genre, and also part of what makes the game so much fun. It’s entertaining to cross the city running as fast as you can without pausing, challenging yourself to get from point A to point B without ever touching the ground.</p><p> If you do happen to find yourself on the ground with a few zombies around you, you’ll have a variety of weapons you can smash a zombies head in with. The game focuses mainly on melee, with occasional firefights with other bandits. The melee weapon system has an upgrade system that involves fusing together found materials. The melee combat is solid, and your swings connect in a satisfying way.</p><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour.</p><p> There are quite a few different types of zombies, and more are introduced the longer you play. There are runners who can parkour right along beside you, frog-men zombies that spit acid, and hulking beasts that swing giant sledgehammers. It’s this variety that keeps the gameplay fun―until night falls.</p><p> Harran is a whole different city at night. If you aren’t in a safe zone, you’ll quickly learn that running through the city at night is terrifying, specifically because of a zombie type called volatiles. Volatiles are crazy strong, super-fast, and will chase after you relentlessly until you get out of sight―not an easy thing to do when you’re freaking out. It can be a real rush to try to do a mission at night, so if things aren’t feeling tense enough for you, just wait until the sunsets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YctEePpYKsIXQ5kU-hQ8w7o9CDo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-4-1edeaf05c6ba435e9b81e68a13831ac6.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> The graphics of Dying Light compare well to other triple-A titles, though it feels like the developers took more care with the scenery than the characters. Human models look a little plasticky, but the world around you is textured beautifully and rich with small details like posters and graffiti that help make the world around you feel real.</p><p> Character animation is also excellent, and the buildings and other objects within the world offer a variety of ways to jump, climb, and crawl. The open urban landscape of Harran allows players to decide how they want to explore, acquire materials, and fight. You’ll be able to come at certain locations from a variety of angles,and it’s this sense of freedom and attention to the environments that brings Dying Light together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sy9NHLj8JNe2eaeS9HJJdejt6QE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-6-56ef808272b544e6a1038f4a5d0280f1.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend"></a><strong>Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend</strong></h2><p> On PlayStation 4, you can purchase the game for $14, a fantastic value. You’ll get more than enough gameplay and fun to justify a purchase at that low cost. However, if you want to play on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll have to either wait for the game to go on sale, or you’ll have to pay $40. Considering the game is older now, we’d suggest getting the game on sale (it goes on sale often through Steam). There’s a lot of fun to be had in Dying Light, especially if you have a friend to play with, so if you’re thinking about getting the game, we’d say go for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137219/26400" target="_top" id="2137219">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137219" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137219/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other zombie and parkour games"></a><strong>Competition: Other zombie and parkour games</strong></h2><p> There are a lot of other zombie survival games out there, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’d recommend them if you liked Dying Light. You might consider Days Gone, another PlayStation 4 zombie apocalypse game set in an open world, but if the parkour was the main attraction, you might look into the game Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. The game follows a girl in a sci-fi world and features first-person parkour running and fighting. Instead of the rough and gritty world of Dying Light, Catalyst takes place in a sleek futuristic dystopia that’s all glossy chrome and burnished glass.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An original in the zombie survival genre.</strong></p><p> Dying Light is a game that took an overdone trope and used it to create a fresh game. Its fun parkour and co-op gameplay make for a great gaming experience, particularly when shared with friends. The variety of zombie enemies combined with the excellent melee combat keep the experience fresh even in the late game―and if things feel too simple, doing a mission at night is a wholly different experience from daylight outings. Dying Light is a great game in the zombie survival genre that we would recommend to most players.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Dying Light</li><li>Price  $14.00</li><li>Available Platforms  PC (Steam) Playstation 4 Xbox One OS X Linux</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-troubleshoot-tweets-on-chrome-not-loading/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Troubleshoot Tweets on Chrome Not Loading</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-elevate-your-social-feed-with-superior-twit-hd-vids/"><u>[New] Elevate Your Social Feed with Superior Twit HD Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-cutting-edge-techniques-for-youtube-video-production-with-sony-vegas/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Cutting-Edge Techniques for YouTube Video Production with Sony Vegas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-advanced-mp4-to-facebook-converter-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Advanced MP4-to-Facebook Converter for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-direct-video-tweet-to-twitter-apps-no-retweets-involved/"><u>[Updated] Direct Video Tweet to Twitter Apps, No Retweets Involved</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-from-zero-to-hero-on-twitter-live/"><u>[Updated] From Zero to Hero on Twitter Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cross-platform-video-tutorial-twitter-to-instagram/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Cross-Platform Video Tutorial Twitter to Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-hack-grabbing-gif-images-from-tweets-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Hack Grabbing GIF Images From Tweets for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capturing-discords-magic-3-steps-for-ensuring-your-live-stream-stays-alive/"><u>2024 Approved Capturing Discord's Magic 3 Steps for Ensuring Your Live Stream Stays Alive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tweeting-tunes-converting-videos-into-melodic-gifs/"><u>2024 Approved Tweeting Tunes Converting Videos Into Melodic GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/addrom-bypass-an-android-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-for-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-by-drfone-android/"><u>AddROM Bypass An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your Samsung Galaxy S23+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/elite-5-non-twitter-channels-online-for-2024/"><u>Elite 5 Non-Twitter Channels Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/full-solutions-to-fix-error-code-920-in-google-play-on-oppo-a1x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Full Solutions to Fix Error Code 920 In Google Play on Oppo A1x 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/get-your-epson-v700-driver-here-supports-windows-7-through-to-10/"><u>Get Your Epson V700 Driver Here!
