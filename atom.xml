Still, for those who don’t know the man, Elon Musk is a flamboyant entrepreneur best known as the co-founder of PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA) and the creator of SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, among other ventures. He happens to have tweeted one of the most viewed Twitter videos in 2022.</p><p>He now works as the CEO of Tesla and the CEO and chief designer of SpaceX. He is expected to have a total net worth of $151 billion by 2022. Only Jeff Bezos comes close to him in terms of wealth as the world’s wealthiest person. The rest, you can figure out…</p><p>As for the video, which has gathered a total of 4.6M on Twitter, it says: “me fighting in the metaverse prison yard where I’m doing time for screenshotting nfts.”</p><p>NFTs and Metaverse, we are stepping into a virtual world, aren’t we?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-2.png"                      alt="Video of A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><h3 id="3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX"><a href="#3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX" class="headerlink" title="3. **Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX"></a>3. **<strong>Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX</strong></h3><p>SpaceX’s Falcon 9 medium-lift launch system is a partly reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift spacecraft developed and constructed in the United States. The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.</p><p>As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.</p><p>And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9’s first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.</p><p>Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-3.png"                      alt="A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><h3 id="4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer"><a href="#4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="4.

This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy. On December 9, 2021, he tweeted a video that only lasts 58 seconds but has received more than 2M views as the world prepares to enter 2022.</p><p>Bill said, I remain hopeful about the prospects for accelerated innovation in the climate field. I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-5.png"                      alt="Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"                ></p><h3 id="6-Neymar’s-Dribbling"><a href="#6-Neymar’s-Dribbling" class="headerlink" title="6.

The Brazilian has 202 club goals in 346 matches and 53 international goals in 83 outings.</p><p>This video is basically about Neymar dribbling in the opposition’s half for fun. Neymar is regarded as one of the best dribblers of this generation of football players. The idea of posting this video was to tell the viewers how good Neymar is when it comes to dribbling and how you just have to sit back and enjoy when he is on the ball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-6.png"                      alt="Neymar&#39;s Dribbling"                ></p><h3 id="7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets"><a href="#7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets" class="headerlink" title="7.

Virat Kohli is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and arguably the greatest. He is undoubtedly the best batsman of this cricketing generation.</p><p>Virat has 71 international tons under his belt, only second to the great Sachin Tendulkar. Virat is also considered among the most exemplary leaders in the history of Cricket. He has hundreds of records in his feather to date.</p><p>Now talking about the video, the sound when the ball is hitting his bat and how he is timing the ball even in the nets is mesmerizing for every cricket fan. It depicts the hard work and dedication he puts in his work. Moreover, he is idolized worldwide for what he has achieved as a batsman and Indian Cricket Team’s captain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-7.png"                      alt="Virat Kohli Practicing in Nets"                ></p><h3 id="8-Ozark-Season-4-Part-1-Trailer"><a href="#8-Ozark-Season-4-Part-1-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="8.

Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-5.png"                      alt="Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"                ></p><h3 id="6-Neymar’s-Dribbling-3"><a href="#6-Neymar’s-Dribbling-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

The Brazilian has 202 club goals in 346 matches and 53 international goals in 83 outings.</p><p>This video is basically about Neymar dribbling in the opposition’s half for fun. Neymar is regarded as one of the best dribblers of this generation of football players.

There are over 500 million tweets shared every day!</p><p>Whether you want to have a funny banter with your followers, follow your favorite celebrity or keep up with the latest global news, Twitter is the best option. You can find a vast pool of content on Twitter, including one-line tweets to threads, pictures, gifs, and videos.</p><p>However, many users often complain about no sound on Twitter videos. If your Twitter videos have no sound, it also leads to a bad user experience.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss the reasons why is there no sound on Twitter videos and the best solution to fix this issue.</p><p>So, let’s begin!</p><h2 id="Why-Is-There-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos"><a href="#Why-Is-There-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Is There No Sound on Twitter Videos?"></a>Why Is There No Sound on Twitter Videos?</h2><p>There are many reasons for no sound on uploaded twitter videos. The issue could be with your device, browser, or the Twitter app itself.</p><p>Here are all the possible reasons why there is no sound on Twitter videos.</p><h3 id="1-Problem-with-the-App"><a href="#1-Problem-with-the-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Problem with the App"></a>1. Problem with the App</h3><p>There could be a problem with Twitter video sound because of an in-app issue. For example, you have an outdated version of the app, or the app cache is full. Things like that can often create issues and hinder the app’s functionality.</p><h3 id="2-Network-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Network-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Network Connectivity"></a>2. Network Connectivity</h3><p>A weak network connection can also be a common cause of no sound or poor video quality. With a weak or faulty connection, you will see a loading symbol on the video&#x2F;audio file that never seems to end – something painstakingly annoying!</p><p>A strong internet connection will avoid Twitter videos’ improper functionality and smoothly load the file’s contents.</p><h3 id="3-Old-Browsers"><a href="#3-Old-Browsers" class="headerlink" title="3. Old Browsers"></a>3. Old Browsers</h3><p>An old browser lags and does not load files properly. Thus, it can be a reason for no audio on the Twitter videos. Either update the browser or switch to a new browser altogether.</p><h3 id="4-The-Twitter-Cache"><a href="#4-The-Twitter-Cache" class="headerlink" title="4. The Twitter Cache"></a>4. The Twitter Cache</h3><p>The browser cookies or cache and Twitter application cache can also cause Twitter video sound problems. When the cache is full, the app or browser will not perform to its optimal potential.</p><h3 id="5-System-Software-Updates"><a href="#5-System-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="5. System Software Updates"></a>5. System Software Updates</h3><p>Your device could also cause no sound on the Twitter video. When you don’t update the operating system software of your PC&#x2F;Phone, it can cause errors in the device and lead to functionality issues. Moreover, the Twitter app might also not be compatible with an outdated system.</p><h3 id="6-Device-Storage"><a href="#6-Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="6. Device Storage"></a>6. Device Storage</h3><p>When the device memory is full, it can lead to formatting issues, causing no sound on Twitter videos.</p><h3 id="7-Video-Format"><a href="#7-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="7. Video Format"></a>7. Video Format</h3><p>An incompatible video format uploaded on Twitter will also have no sound. Sometimes, there is nothing you can do about it if the video format is incorrect. It will show all kinds of errors, including no sound.</p><h2 id="How-to-Fix-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos-on-Chrome"><a href="#How-to-Fix-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos-on-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix No Sound on Twitter Videos on Chrome?"></a>How to Fix No Sound on Twitter Videos on Chrome?</h2><p>Sometimes no sound on Twitter videos could be due to a browser-related issue. Let’s talk about all the possible methods to fix no sound on Twitter videos on Chrome:</p><h3 id="1-Enable-Flash"><a href="#1-Enable-Flash" class="headerlink" title="1. Enable Flash"></a>1. Enable Flash</h3><p>If Chrome flash is disabled, then your videos will not play on Chrome. Click on the lock shape icon on the address bar, and make sure flash is not blocked.</p><p>If flash is disabled and outdated, install the updated version.</p><p>![Check for flash player and updates](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why-" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why- <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is-there-no-sound-on-twitter- videos-1.jpg)</p><h3 id="2-Clear-Cookies-and-Cache"><a href="#2-Clear-Cookies-and-Cache" class="headerlink" title="2. Clear Cookies and Cache"></a>2. Clear Cookies and Cache</h3><p>Sounds too simple right? But you’d be surprised to know that 99% of browser-related problems are fixed once you clear cookies and cache.</p><p>To clear cookies and cache:</p><ul><li>Go to Chrome Settings by clicking on the three vertical dots in the top right corner of the browser.</li><li>Search for Cookie and select ‘clear browsing data’ under Security and privacy.</li><li>Select ‘Cookies and other site data’ and ‘cached images and files’ and click on Clear Data.</li></ul><p>![Clear cache for smooth browser experience](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why-" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why- <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is-there-no-sound-on-twitter- videos-2.jpg)</p><p>Hopefully, this will resolve the issue of no Twitter video sound on the Chrome browser.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-Chrome-Plugins-Extensions"><a href="#3-Disable-Chrome-Plugins-Extensions" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable Chrome Plugins&#x2F;Extensions"></a>3. Disable Chrome Plugins&#x2F;Extensions</h3><p>If none of the steps above have worked so far and your Twitter videos are playing in other browsers except for Chrome, try managing your extensions.</p><p>For this, you have to disable Chrome extensions and reload to check if the Twitter video plays audio.</p><p>Here is how you can do this:</p><ul><li>Click on the three dots on the top right corner of the address bar and select More Tools &gt; “Extensions.”</li><li>Your Chrome extensions will be listed so you can easily manage them one by one.</li></ul><p>You can also do this:</p><ul><li>Type <strong>chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;extensions</strong> in the search bar and hit Enter.</li><li>Turn off all the plugins, particularly the advertisement blockers.</li><li>Now close the browser and launch again.</li></ul><p>![Disable plug-ins and extensions](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why-" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why- <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is-there-no-sound-on-twitter- videos-3.jpg)</p><p>This should resolve the issue and play sound on Twitter videos in Chrome.</p><h3 id="4-Disable-Hardware-Acceleration"><a href="#4-Disable-Hardware-Acceleration" class="headerlink" title="4. Disable Hardware Acceleration"></a>4. Disable Hardware Acceleration</h3><p>If managing your extensions did not do the job for you, disabling hardware acceleration in Chrome might help resolve the issue.</p><p>Follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Type <strong>chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;settings</strong>in the address bar of Chrome browser and press Enter.</li><li>Scroll down to System and turn off Use hardware acceleration when available.</li><li>Close the window and launch Chrome again. Now load the Twitter video again and play.</li></ul><p>![Disable hardware acceleration to solve issue](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why-" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why- <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is-there-no-sound-on-twitter- videos-4.jpg)</p><h3 id="5-Update-Your-Browser"><a href="#5-Update-Your-Browser" class="headerlink" title="5. Update Your Browser"></a>5.

Not only are video ads Twitter’s fastest-growing format, but there are also about 1.2 billion videos viewed every day on Twitter.</p><p>However, many of these businesses, marketers, and advertisers do not know how exactly to get positive results on Twitter videos. They do not know what length their videos should be, what best video dimensions for Twitter to upload, and what type of file format to use.</p><p>With a positive impression for twitter videos, please explore all your potential engagement, conversions, and clicks on the table. This post will summarize everything you need to know about the best technical requirements, Twitter square video dimensions, maximum Twitter video size and video formats that you need to know.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Twitter Video Requirement](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Twitter Video Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform](#Part 3)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter-Video-Requirement"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter-Video-Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Twitter Video Requirement"></a>Part 1 Twitter Video Requirement</h2><p>There has been a rise in video uploads since videos thrive on Twitter compared to other platforms. There have been reports that videos are three times more likely to be retweeted than tweets with GIFs and six times more likely to be retweeted than tweets with photos, and that’s not all. Twitter is ranked as the top platform for “coming across videos” easily, but not searching like other media. Are you convinced but not sure on how to do it? We’ll tell you how to post videos to Twitter.</p><h3 id="How-to-upload-a-video-to-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-upload-a-video-to-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to upload a video to Twitter"></a>How to upload a video to Twitter</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-2.jpg"                      alt="best video dimensions for twitter"                ></p><p>How can you upload a video that you already created to Twitter? First, you need to log into your Twitter account at twitter.com then upload your photos from your computer. Then, click on the icon to upload videos or pictures to your tweet and choose the file you are interested in from your computer.</p><p>Are you trying to upload a video from your phone to your Twitter account? Both processes are the same. Create a new tweet, and then click the icon to upload a video clip or a photo, and you can choose your desired video from your device. It is also possible to trim your video clip if you are interested in a specific part.</p><h3 id="Twitter-video-upload-requirements"><a href="#Twitter-video-upload-requirements" class="headerlink" title="Twitter video upload requirements"></a>Twitter video upload requirements</h3><p>Ensure that your video quality meets the required resolution and length required by Twitter before uploading it. Therefore, take note of these;</p><ul><li>Videos must not exceed 2minutes 20 seconds</li><li>Formats supported are MOV and MP4 on mobile apps and MP4 audio format on the web.</li><li>The Twitter video file size for Twitter videos is 32 x 32, and the maximum Twitter video size is 1200 x 1900 or1920 x 1200</li><li>Twitter video full file size should be 512 Mb. If you want to upload a bigger file, Twitter will automatically reject it since the full-size Twitter video has passed.</li></ul><h3 id="How-to-record-a-video-on-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-record-a-video-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to record a video on Twitter"></a>How to record a video on Twitter</h3><p>You can create a video directly on Twitter in two ways, and both features can be found on the Twitter app only—recording a video and going live. You will get an option to perform either of these by clicking the icon on the app above the tweet interface, as shown in the screenshot below.</p><p>You can create a video directly on Twitter in two ways, and both features can be found on the Twitter app only—recording a video and going live. You will get an option to perform either of these by clicking the icon on the app above the tweet interface, as shown in the screenshot below.</p><p>“Camera” enables you to capture your moments directly and create a video for Twitter, and “Live” will allow you to share with the world whatever you are doing right at the moment by going live.</p><p>While using the “Camera” function, it is possible to hold down to drag and drop and record multiple clips to trim and rearrange them.</p><p>Another feature is the “Live” function; you will click “Go live” and, when you have completed, click on “End video.” Live videos will be posted automatically as tweets so that your followers can find and watch them even after you’ve completed streaming live. It is also possible to download the live video from the web to your device if you’d like.</p><p>And that’s it! If you are using video on Twitter, what outcomes have you seen? The experience is quite good, but how do you do it right? And if you are looking forward to learning more, Find out from the Twitter guide below.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Twitter-Video-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-Twitter-Video-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Twitter Video Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 Twitter Video Aspect Ratio</h2><p>It is explained as the ratio between the height and the width of the video. It decides how long your video will be. As you would have speculated, the aspect ratio can also be used regarding pictures; however, since we’re discussing the video in this article, we won’t deviate to incorporating the aspect ratio for the image.</p><p>● The aspect ratio is written as x:y.</p><p>The 1st number of the aspect ratio refers to the width, while the 2nd number of the aspect ratio refers to the height of the video.</p><p>The videos on Twitter have become the most used content in recent years. The best aspect ratio that should be used in Twitter for videos is 1:2.39 and 2.39:1. You have to make sure that you should go for a higher aspect ratio for videos. Opting higher aspect ratio makes your videos take up more space the engagement of the videos depends upon the visibility of the videos. The higher the visibility, the higher will be the engagement.</p><p>Twitter recommends two aspect ratios for twitter videos.</p><p>● For landscape or portrait, it recommends 16:9.</p><p>For square, it recommends 1:1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-5.jpg"                      alt="twitter video aspect ratio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform"></a>Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform</h2><h3 id="1-Keep-it-short-and-simple"><a href="#1-Keep-it-short-and-simple" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep it short and simple"></a>1. Keep it short and simple</h3><p>Currently, the world is moving fast; therefore, humans can get distracted instantly, grabbing their attention is easy. But if you want to get the real deal, you’ll need to make the initial part of your video attractive enough for them to wait and watch the other part of the video.</p><p>The first 3 seconds of your video should always carry the main message you intended to share. Also, try as much as possible to make videos in less than 15 seconds to maximize branding impact.</p><p>Employ the same strategy for your tweet copy and try to keep it concise and crisp and stay below 100 characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-6.JPG"                      alt="twitter video file size"                ></p><h3 id="2-Include-Product-and-People"><a href="#2-Include-Product-and-People" class="headerlink" title="2. Include Product and People"></a>2. Include Product and People</h3><p>Twitter recommends opening up ads while the product is on focus. This has led to a 34% increase in click intent and a 24% increase in positive interest. Twitter also says that having products with human touch or any association with them resulted in an overall response increase by 40 %.</p><p>So you should ensure that your video has a positive human engagement and desire for the product in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-4.jpg"                      alt="maximum twitter video size"                ></p><h3 id="3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach"><a href="#3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach"></a>3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach</h3><p>Hashtags are very common on Twitter, and you will rarely find videos that do not have hashtags. This feature is very helpful because it helps you classify your videos, making them quick to access.</p><p>Many hashtags might be used on a post, but when it comes to Twitter, less is more. So try to stick to 1-2 important hashtags in your Twitter copy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-3.jpg"                      alt="use trending hashtags for twitter"                ></p><h3 id="4-Flash-that-Logo"><a href="#4-Flash-that-Logo" class="headerlink" title="4. Flash that Logo"></a>4. Flash that Logo</h3><p>Twitter recommends that brands place their logos within their video frame and just immediately at the start of the video to drive brand association from the beginning. When logos are placed evidently, the brand recall will increase by 30%.</p><p>You can also put your logo in the upper right or left-hand corner of your video to increase the chances of the brand recall but make sure it is in a more catchy position.</p><h3 id="5-Include-Captions"><a href="#5-Include-Captions" class="headerlink" title="5. Include Captions"></a>5. Include Captions</h3><p>93% of videos on Twitter are viewed through mobile phones; therefore, it’s important to have a video accompanied by sound. This is because many people use Twitter and other social media when they are on the go, and in some cases, they might not access sound.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to use captions and other forms of text to give your video more context so that the viewers can better understand the context.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-1.jpg"                      alt="add captions in twitter video"                ></p><h3 id="6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool"><a href="#6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool" class="headerlink" title="6.

This tool has made it possible to throw in overlays, make elements and come up with animations, insert texts and audios. It’s a one stop solution for advanced video editing to make them look professional.

You need to place the Tweet video or image on the video track and then place your reaction video directly above it. The top video should be in a larger size so make sure to adjust its size by clicking on the video and opening it in the preview. Now, drag the handles inward or outward to position the video.</p><p><strong>● Step 3: Use editing tools</strong></p><p>There are over 60 motion effects, numerous transitions, and visual effects to add flair and appeal to your reaction video.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable"><a href="#●-Be-relatable" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body"><a href="#●-Use-your-body" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects"><a href="#●-Use-effects" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip. And, that’s why using the Filmora video editor is a valuable choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Twitter has also jumped on the short video bandwagon to join TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

Not only are video ads Twitter’s fastest-growing format, but there are also about 1.2 billion videos viewed every day on Twitter.</p><p>However, many of these businesses, marketers, and advertisers do not know how exactly to get positive results on Twitter videos. They do not know what length their videos should be, what best video dimensions for Twitter to upload, and what type of file format to use.</p><p>With a positive impression for twitter videos, please explore all your potential engagement, conversions, and clicks on the table. This post will summarize everything you need to know about the best technical requirements, Twitter square video dimensions, maximum Twitter video size and video formats that you need to know.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Twitter Video Requirement](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Twitter Video Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform](#Part 3)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter-Video-Requirement"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter-Video-Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Twitter Video Requirement"></a>Part 1 Twitter Video Requirement</h2><p>There has been a rise in video uploads since videos thrive on Twitter compared to other platforms. There have been reports that videos are three times more likely to be retweeted than tweets with GIFs and six times more likely to be retweeted than tweets with photos, and that’s not all. Twitter is ranked as the top platform for “coming across videos” easily, but not searching like other media. Are you convinced but not sure on how to do it? We’ll tell you how to post videos to Twitter.</p><h3 id="How-to-upload-a-video-to-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-upload-a-video-to-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to upload a video to Twitter"></a>How to upload a video to Twitter</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-2.jpg"                      alt="best video dimensions for twitter"                ></p><p>How can you upload a video that you already created to Twitter? First, you need to log into your Twitter account at twitter.com then upload your photos from your computer. Then, click on the icon to upload videos or pictures to your tweet and choose the file you are interested in from your computer.</p><p>Are you trying to upload a video from your phone to your Twitter account? Both processes are the same. Create a new tweet, and then click the icon to upload a video clip or a photo, and you can choose your desired video from your device. It is also possible to trim your video clip if you are interested in a specific part.</p><h3 id="Twitter-video-upload-requirements"><a href="#Twitter-video-upload-requirements" class="headerlink" title="Twitter video upload requirements"></a>Twitter video upload requirements</h3><p>Ensure that your video quality meets the required resolution and length required by Twitter before uploading it. Therefore, take note of these;</p><ul><li>Videos must not exceed 2minutes 20 seconds</li><li>Formats supported are MOV and MP4 on mobile apps and MP4 audio format on the web.</li><li>The Twitter video file size for Twitter videos is 32 x 32, and the maximum Twitter video size is 1200 x 1900 or1920 x 1200</li><li>Twitter video full file size should be 512 Mb. If you want to upload a bigger file, Twitter will automatically reject it since the full-size Twitter video has passed.</li></ul><h3 id="How-to-record-a-video-on-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-record-a-video-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to record a video on Twitter"></a>How to record a video on Twitter</h3><p>You can create a video directly on Twitter in two ways, and both features can be found on the Twitter app only—recording a video and going live. You will get an option to perform either of these by clicking the icon on the app above the tweet interface, as shown in the screenshot below.</p><p>You can create a video directly on Twitter in two ways, and both features can be found on the Twitter app only—recording a video and going live. You will get an option to perform either of these by clicking the icon on the app above the tweet interface, as shown in the screenshot below.</p><p>“Camera” enables you to capture your moments directly and create a video for Twitter, and “Live” will allow you to share with the world whatever you are doing right at the moment by going live.</p><p>While using the “Camera” function, it is possible to hold down to drag and drop and record multiple clips to trim and rearrange them.</p><p>Another feature is the “Live” function; you will click “Go live” and, when you have completed, click on “End video.” Live videos will be posted automatically as tweets so that your followers can find and watch them even after you’ve completed streaming live. It is also possible to download the live video from the web to your device if you’d like.</p><p>And that’s it! If you are using video on Twitter, what outcomes have you seen? The experience is quite good, but how do you do it right? And if you are looking forward to learning more, Find out from the Twitter guide below.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Twitter-Video-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-Twitter-Video-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Twitter Video Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 Twitter Video Aspect Ratio</h2><p>It is explained as the ratio between the height and the width of the video. It decides how long your video will be. As you would have speculated, the aspect ratio can also be used regarding pictures; however, since we’re discussing the video in this article, we won’t deviate to incorporating the aspect ratio for the image.</p><p>● The aspect ratio is written as x:y.</p><p>The 1st number of the aspect ratio refers to the width, while the 2nd number of the aspect ratio refers to the height of the video.</p><p>The videos on Twitter have become the most used content in recent years. The best aspect ratio that should be used in Twitter for videos is 1:2.39 and 2.39:1. You have to make sure that you should go for a higher aspect ratio for videos. Opting higher aspect ratio makes your videos take up more space the engagement of the videos depends upon the visibility of the videos. The higher the visibility, the higher will be the engagement.</p><p>Twitter recommends two aspect ratios for twitter videos.</p><p>● For landscape or portrait, it recommends 16:9.</p><p>For square, it recommends 1:1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-5.jpg"                      alt="twitter video aspect ratio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform"></a>Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform</h2><h3 id="1-Keep-it-short-and-simple"><a href="#1-Keep-it-short-and-simple" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep it short and simple"></a>1. Keep it short and simple</h3><p>Currently, the world is moving fast; therefore, humans can get distracted instantly, grabbing their attention is easy. But if you want to get the real deal, you’ll need to make the initial part of your video attractive enough for them to wait and watch the other part of the video.</p><p>The first 3 seconds of your video should always carry the main message you intended to share. Also, try as much as possible to make videos in less than 15 seconds to maximize branding impact.</p><p>Employ the same strategy for your tweet copy and try to keep it concise and crisp and stay below 100 characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-6.JPG"                      alt="twitter video file size"                ></p><h3 id="2-Include-Product-and-People"><a href="#2-Include-Product-and-People" class="headerlink" title="2. Include Product and People"></a>2. Include Product and People</h3><p>Twitter recommends opening up ads while the product is on focus. This has led to a 34% increase in click intent and a 24% increase in positive interest. Twitter also says that having products with human touch or any association with them resulted in an overall response increase by 40 %.</p><p>So you should ensure that your video has a positive human engagement and desire for the product in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-4.jpg"                      alt="maximum twitter video size"                ></p><h3 id="3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach"><a href="#3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach"></a>3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach</h3><p>Hashtags are very common on Twitter, and you will rarely find videos that do not have hashtags. This feature is very helpful because it helps you classify your videos, making them quick to access.</p><p>Many hashtags might be used on a post, but when it comes to Twitter, less is more. So try to stick to 1-2 important hashtags in your Twitter copy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-3.jpg"                      alt="use trending hashtags for twitter"                ></p><h3 id="4-Flash-that-Logo"><a href="#4-Flash-that-Logo" class="headerlink" title="4. Flash that Logo"></a>4. Flash that Logo</h3><p>Twitter recommends that brands place their logos within their video frame and just immediately at the start of the video to drive brand association from the beginning. When logos are placed evidently, the brand recall will increase by 30%.</p><p>You can also put your logo in the upper right or left-hand corner of your video to increase the chances of the brand recall but make sure it is in a more catchy position.</p><h3 id="5-Include-Captions"><a href="#5-Include-Captions" class="headerlink" title="5. Include Captions"></a>5. Include Captions</h3><p>93% of videos on Twitter are viewed through mobile phones; therefore, it’s important to have a video accompanied by sound. This is because many people use Twitter and other social media when they are on the go, and in some cases, they might not access sound.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to use captions and other forms of text to give your video more context so that the viewers can better understand the context.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-1.jpg"                      alt="add captions in twitter video"                ></p><h3 id="6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool"><a href="#6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool" class="headerlink" title="6. Use the Filmora video editing tool"></a>6. Use the Filmora video editing tool</h3><p>Filmora gives its users many options for adding effects, styling, and customizing videos. This tool has made it possible to throw in overlays, make elements and come up with animations, insert texts and audios. It’s a one stop solution for advanced video editing to make them look professional. Moreover, you can achieve best video dimensions for Twitter videos by using Filmora.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Provides both video and audio Controls.</li><li>It has GIF support function.</li><li>Interesting audio equalizer option.</li><li>4K Resolution editing support available.</li><li>Allows split screen.</li></ul><h3 id="7-Engage-More-Than-You-Broadcast"><a href="#7-Engage-More-Than-You-Broadcast" class="headerlink" title="7.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5.

There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you!

From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort-3"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort-3" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Every month, Amazon Prime Video, the well-known streaming service, releases new series, movies, and documentaries that many people share across <strong>prime video Twitter</strong> with viewing.
