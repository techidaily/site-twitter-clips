Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Dying Light is a first-person action-adventure game set in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Its headline feature is kinetic parkour traversal through an open-world infested with unique zombies.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_0yEidfS3S4dy57s584t378TZYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-5-4ec68914607c4b56acff25a78887af7f.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Straight-into-the-action"><a href="#Setup-Process-Straight-into-the-action" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Straight into the action"></a><strong>Setup Process: Straight into the action</strong></h2><p> The first time you launch the game you’ll be treated to an artistic video over the background of a news report. It explains the situation in Harran, the city where the game takes place. The game proper starts with a cut scene that shows you on a plane, about to parachute out. There’s no character creation here, although once you get a little further into the game, you’ll be able to pick your clothes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/P3rXmBBI1GdQfgi0vVT9xKcFw90=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-2-db5990d1f64341eaae79e22a71bb8f95.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115951/19272" target="_top" id="2115951">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115951" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115951/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship"><a href="#Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship"></a><strong>Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship</strong></h2><p> The initial cutscene starts with you on a plane, preparing to jump. Your name is Kyle Crane, and you’re an undercover operative. You’ll parachute to the earth while your boss explains your mission―to find a stolen file―but the second you hit the ground, things don’t go as planned. You’re attacked and forced to fire your weapon to scatter your attackers. Of course, in zombie-infested Harran, a gunshot is zombie bait. Suddenly they’re swarming toward you and things look very dire, until you’re rescued by a pair of strangers, a man and a woman. The man dies saving you but you and the woman escape. Her name is Jade, and she’ll play a big role throughout the story as you try to win her and her brother’s trust.</p><p>Harran is a whole different city at night.</p><p> You’re a spy sent in to infiltrate this group of survivors by the Global Relief Effort or GRE, but now that they’ve saved your life, you start to feel like you owe them. They’ll send you on missions to prove yourself, such as setting up traps for air raid supply drops or battling the hostile bandits that prowl Harran’s streets. Throughout the game, you balance accomplishing the GRE’s task with serving the best interest of this group of survivors you find yourself increasingly attached to.</p><p> This is a fairly linear game with regards to the plot. There’s a main storyline for you to follow, with some optional side quests that you can take or leave. The narrative does a decent job of building up the circumstances for Kyle feeling torn between his mission and these people, and you’ll learn more about the virus as you go, as well as Antizin, the fictional drug that could lead to a cure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8G35q3VsoSEuht_3bqsGm0Pwz-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-7-d9d2bbe8881e476f8dfb3c13059634ed.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore"><a href="#Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore"></a><strong>Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore</strong></h2><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour. Other zombie games focus on having slow zombies you can run away from, or dumb zombies you sneak past, but Dying Light takes a completely different approach. Instead, the basic zombies are fast and almost always know where you are―but they can’t climb or jump. This means you can stay safe by leaping between rooftops, running up ramps, balancing across bars, etc. The parkour feature is the biggest thing that makes Dying Light unique in an oversaturated genre, and also part of what makes the game so much fun. It’s entertaining to cross the city running as fast as you can without pausing, challenging yourself to get from point A to point B without ever touching the ground.</p><p> If you do happen to find yourself on the ground with a few zombies around you, you’ll have a variety of weapons you can smash a zombies head in with. The game focuses mainly on melee, with occasional firefights with other bandits. The melee weapon system has an upgrade system that involves fusing together found materials. The melee combat is solid, and your swings connect in a satisfying way.</p><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour.</p><p> There are quite a few different types of zombies, and more are introduced the longer you play. There are runners who can parkour right along beside you, frog-men zombies that spit acid, and hulking beasts that swing giant sledgehammers. It’s this variety that keeps the gameplay fun―until night falls.</p><p> Harran is a whole different city at night. If you aren’t in a safe zone, you’ll quickly learn that running through the city at night is terrifying, specifically because of a zombie type called volatiles. Volatiles are crazy strong, super-fast, and will chase after you relentlessly until you get out of sight―not an easy thing to do when you’re freaking out. It can be a real rush to try to do a mission at night, so if things aren’t feeling tense enough for you, just wait until the sunsets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YctEePpYKsIXQ5kU-hQ8w7o9CDo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-4-1edeaf05c6ba435e9b81e68a13831ac6.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> The graphics of Dying Light compare well to other triple-A titles, though it feels like the developers took more care with the scenery than the characters. Human models look a little plasticky, but the world around you is textured beautifully and rich with small details like posters and graffiti that help make the world around you feel real.</p><p> Character animation is also excellent, and the buildings and other objects within the world offer a variety of ways to jump, climb, and crawl. The open urban landscape of Harran allows players to decide how they want to explore, acquire materials, and fight. You’ll be able to come at certain locations from a variety of angles,and it’s this sense of freedom and attention to the environments that brings Dying Light together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sy9NHLj8JNe2eaeS9HJJdejt6QE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-6-56ef808272b544e6a1038f4a5d0280f1.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123750/7443" target="_top" id="2123750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123750/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137394/7443" target="_top" id="2137394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend"></a><strong>Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend</strong></h2><p> On PlayStation 4, you can purchase the game for $14, a fantastic value. You’ll get more than enough gameplay and fun to justify a purchase at that low cost. However, if you want to play on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll have to either wait for the game to go on sale, or you’ll have to pay $40. Considering the game is older now, we’d suggest getting the game on sale (it goes on sale often through Steam). There’s a lot of fun to be had in Dying Light, especially if you have a friend to play with, so if you’re thinking about getting the game, we’d say go for it.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other zombie and parkour games"></a><strong>Competition: Other zombie and parkour games</strong></h2><p> There are a lot of other zombie survival games out there, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’d recommend them if you liked Dying Light. You might consider Days Gone, another PlayStation 4 zombie apocalypse game set in an open world, but if the parkour was the main attraction, you might look into the game Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. The game follows a girl in a sci-fi world and features first-person parkour running and fighting. Instead of the rough and gritty world of Dying Light, Catalyst takes place in a sleek futuristic dystopia that’s all glossy chrome and burnished glass.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An original in the zombie survival genre.</strong></p><p> Dying Light is a game that took an overdone trope and used it to create a fresh game. Its fun parkour and co-op gameplay make for a great gaming experience, particularly when shared with friends. The variety of zombie enemies combined with the excellent melee combat keep the experience fresh even in the late game―and if things feel too simple, doing a mission at night is a wholly different experience from daylight outings. Dying Light is a great game in the zombie survival genre that we would recommend to most players.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Dying Light</li><li>Price  $14.00</li><li>Available Platforms  PC (Steam) Playstation 4 Xbox One OS X Linux</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-aplus-ppts-into-screen-recording-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A+ PPTs Into Screen Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-enrich-your-tweeting-experience-the-ultimate-toolkit-review-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enrich Your Tweeting Experience The Ultimate Toolkit Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-the-world-of-tweets-starting-fresh-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Navigating the World of Tweets Starting Fresh for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-2023s-amazonprimetrending-top-tweets-that-stood-out/"><u>2024 Approved 2023'S #AmazonPrimeTrending - Top Tweets That Stood Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mcb-video-graphics-pack-for-youtube-channels/"><u>2024 Approved MCB Video Graphics Pack for YouTube Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/choosing-the-best-chatgpt-option-direct-browser-interaction-vs-enhanced-with-plugins/"><u>Choosing the Best ChatGPT Option: Direct Browser Interaction Vs.

The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material.

Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-5.png"                      alt="Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"                ></p><h3 id="6-Neymar’s-Dribbling-3"><a href="#6-Neymar’s-Dribbling-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

The Brazilian has 202 club goals in 346 matches and 53 international goals in 83 outings.</p><p>This video is basically about Neymar dribbling in the opposition’s half for fun. Neymar is regarded as one of the best dribblers of this generation of football players.

You may have assumed it is simply due to the popularity of the service. And while that is part of the reason, there is more to the story. There is a <strong>Periscope Twitter</strong> relationship, which is why you often see Periscope links showing up on your feed. If you want to set up a Twitter live stream, you can use Periscope to get it done.</p><p> Do you know the relationship between Twitter and Periscope?

The acquisition is a major reason why we see so many Periscope videos on Twitter feeds. The company wants to ensure that both services are integrated to the benefit of users who want to broadcast or watch this type of live content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/periscope-twitter.JPG"                      alt="periscope twitter"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-Twitter-and-Periscope-Work-Together-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-Twitter-and-Periscope-Work-Together-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do Twitter and Periscope Work Together?"></a>Part 2: How Do Twitter and Periscope Work Together?</h2><p> If you are hoping to start a live streaming video broadcast, you can get the process rolling within your Twitter app. On both Android and iOS devices, you may go to the compose tweet button, and then select the icon that looks like a video record notification.</p><p> An interesting aspect of the Periscope Twitter integration is that when you start a live video on Twitter, it is accessible on both platforms. People who are on Twitter and wanting to see live videos can search for your video. And the same is true on the Periscope app and website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/periscope-twitter-work.JPG"                      alt="periscope twitter work together"                ></p><p> Alternatively, you could start your live video on the Periscope app. It is entirely your choice.

If you are using a device that has VR capability, such as Samsung smartphones, you can view the 360 degree video through your Gear VR headset. It is also watchable with Google Cardboard.</p><p> If you are using a regular smartphone and you do not have a VR headset, you can simply use your fingers to move around the 360 degree video to access different viewpoints.

You need to place the Tweet video or image on the video track and then place your reaction video directly above it.

Now, drag the handles inward or outward to position the video.</p><p><strong>● Step 3: Use editing tools</strong></p><p>There are over 60 motion effects, numerous transitions, and visual effects to add flair and appeal to your reaction video.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable"><a href="#●-Be-relatable" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body"><a href="#●-Use-your-body" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects"><a href="#●-Use-effects" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything-3"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything-3" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-3"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-3" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-3"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body-3"><a href="#●-Use-your-body-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music-3"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music-3" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects-3"><a href="#●-Use-effects-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Effective-Strategies-for-Twitter-Marketing"><a href="#Effective-Strategies-for-Twitter-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Effective Strategies for Twitter Marketing"></a>Effective Strategies for Twitter Marketing</h2><h1 id="How-to-Advertise-on-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-Advertise-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to Advertise on Twitter"></a>How to Advertise on Twitter</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> A few years after Twitter was launched, the Twitter Ads platform went live. Since 2010 the Twitter’s own advertising platform has enabled countless businesses of all sizes to reach new markets, extend their target audiences and generate profit. From the start, the platform fostered a brand-friendly atmosphere that helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.</p><p> More than half of social media managers think that Twitter is the platform that leads the market in terms of return of investment since 94 percent of the social network’s users have claimed that they planned to buy a product after discovering it on Twitter. In this article, we are going to show you how to advertise on Twitter.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter"><a href="#Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Types of Advertising on Twitter"></a>Types of Advertising on Twitter</h2><p> If your company has reached the decision to start advertising on Twitter, there are three different ways in which you can accomplish this. Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts all offer different opportunities, so let’s take a closer look at each of these options.</p><h4 id="1-Promoted-Accounts"><a href="#1-Promoted-Accounts" class="headerlink" title="1. Promoted Accounts"></a>1. Promoted Accounts</h4><p> As much as 85 percent of users have reported that promoted accounts helped them find new businesses that offer products they were looking for. The true purpose of promoted accounts is to make your Twitter account visible to the audience you targeted and gain more followers in such a manner.</p><p> Promoted accounts appear in timelines of Twitter users that fit in your target group and they also appear in Who to Follow recommendations or search results. If you choose to promote an account you’ll be able to increase its visibility and availability to your potential customers.</p><h4 id="2-Promoted-Tweets"><a href="#2-Promoted-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="2. Promoted Tweets"></a>2. Promoted Tweets</h4><p> Any post you share on Twitter is called a tweet, and a promoted tweet is just the type of tweet a brand paid for so it can reach more people. A promoted tweet is displayed on the user’s timelines, Twitter’s mobile app or high in the search results. You can comment on, retweet or like promoted tweets, which creates a great opportunity to present the services your company offers to Twitter users who don’t follow your account. They also enable you to pick a target group and recommend the products you think they might need.</p><h4 id="3-Promoted-Trends"><a href="#3-Promoted-Trends" class="headerlink" title="3. Promoted Trends"></a>3. Promoted Trends</h4><p> A trend on Twitter is defined as a topic that is most frequently talked about at the moment. You can find the latest trending subjects in the Discover tab on your Twitter account, so using a promoted trend to advertise your brand’s products and services allows you to promote a hashtag at the very top of the Discover tab.</p><p> After someone clicks on the hashtag, they will be able to see a tweet you’re promoting as well as a list of results for the given topic. If people start using that hashtag, more Twitter users will learn about your promoted tweet and enable you to grow the number of your followers organically.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Combining several ad products is the most common method of creating an ad campaign on Twitter, although you can also use a single ad product for the same purpose. These are the types of ad campaigns most frequently used by marketers on Twitter.</p><h4 id="Tweet-Engagements"><a href="#Tweet-Engagements" class="headerlink" title="Tweet Engagements"></a>Tweet Engagements</h4><p> This a simple ad campaign that focuses on increasing the number of people talking about your brand on Twitter. You only have to pay for the first engagement with a user, while all other results of your campaign are free.</p><h4 id="Lead-Generation"><a href="#Lead-Generation" class="headerlink" title="Lead Generation"></a>Lead Generation</h4><p> This service enables you to create Lead Generation cards in Twitter’s ad manager, which contain the user’s email address and their real name as well as their username on the platform. You can download the list of possible leads from your Twitter Ads account.</p><h4 id="Clicks-and-Conversions"><a href="#Clicks-and-Conversions" class="headerlink" title="Clicks and Conversions"></a>Clicks and Conversions</h4><p> This advertising strategy is aimed at driving as much traffic to your website as possible. The service is paid on per click basis, so you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a campaign that isn’t producing results.</p><h4 id="Awareness-and-Followers"><a href="#Awareness-and-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Awareness and Followers"></a>Awareness and Followers</h4><p> If you want to increase the brand awareness, then an awareness campaign is the best solution. This type of campaign presents your profile to an audience you can’t reach and it is the only type of campaign that is based on impressions rather than on engagement rates. Follower campaigns are aimed at increasing the follower base on your Twitter account.</p><h4 id="Fees-and-Payment"><a href="#Fees-and-Payment" class="headerlink" title="Fees and Payment"></a>Fees and Payment</h4><p> Twitter Ads enables you to choose between self-service and full service. If you choose to create your campaign independently you’ll be in charge of the entire process, while the full-service system also includes support from the platform.</p><p> In either case, you will only have to pay for the achieved results, while the rate you’ll pay for each click is determined through the auction system.</p><h2 id="How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Creating a new ad campaign is a simple process that can be completed in just four steps. Here’s how you can set up your first Twitter ad campaign and start enjoying its benefits.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 1"                ></p><p> Open Twitter Ads Manager. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see campaign objectives, select the ones that are most appropriate for your campaign and then click on Create Campaign button. This action will open a new window where you can give a title to your campaign or decide when you want the campaign to start.</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-2.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 2"                ></p><p> In the next step, you will be asked to define your target audience. The platform offers a wide array of targeting options including gender, postal code or language. Twitter Ads offers support through the process, so you can maximize efficiency and reduce the costs of the campaign.</p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-3.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 3"                ></p><p> Once you’ve defined the target audience as precisely as possible, you can move on to set your budget.

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Every month, Amazon Prime Video, the well-known streaming service, releases new series, movies, and documentaries that many people share across <strong>prime video Twitter</strong> with viewing.

The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself?

Twitter had the most following celebrities back in the day, with some net earnings of $1.13 billion.</p><p>You can also post media (pictures and videos) on Twitter without difficulty.

To help you solve that question, we’ve compiled a list of the Top 10 Hot and Viral Videos on Twitter in this article. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-is-Viral-Video"><a href="#What-is-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Viral Video?"></a>What is Viral Video?</h2><p>A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.</p><p>Tweets may become viral for a variety of reasons. They might increase awareness of a problem, create arguments, or even be amusing. But what’s common in them is that they attract the users and the influencers to give their views about them.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips"><a href="#Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips"></a>Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips</h2><p>Viral videos are hard to find on other social sites, but Twitter, an open platform for all users, provides easy access to viral or trendy clips. This quality of Twitter makes it stand out from other social platforms. It helps the user find trendy fashion, sports, cooking, Hollywood, etc., with mere clicks. The following are the top 10 viral hot clips Twitter:</p><h2 id="1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look"><a href="#1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look" class="headerlink" title="1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look"></a>1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look</h2><p>This video reads, “me after seeing Billie’s pictures: #BillieEilish #BillieEilishHotWhile,” which refers to all of us. Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel" class="headerlink" title="2. Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"></a>2. <strong>Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel</strong></h3><p>This video has the caption “Lil Nas X representing the fallen angel Satan.” It was posted on May 27, 2021. However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3. Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"></a>3. <strong>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating</strong></h3><p>The title for this video hot on Twitter reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.” This video has 572K views, and it was posted on November 19, 2021.</p><p>It displays Paul Rudd laughing and replying “Not me” to the interviewer’s question, “Look at us, who would have thought?”, clearly demonstrating the fan’s feelings after hearing the news that Pete and Kim Kardashian, days after Kanye and Kim broke up.</p><p>The title for this viral Twitter video reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.”</p><p>Kim Kardashian’s divorce from Kanye West was possibly this year’s most unexpected yet unsurprising occurrence in popular culture history. According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty" class="headerlink" title="4. Children Being Naughty"></a>4. <strong>Children Being Naughty</strong></h3><p>The hot viral Twitter clip has the caption saying, “Even more reasons not to have kids.” It was uploaded on January 24, 2022, by the well-known Twitter account @LADBible. LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious. In this video, children are doing crazy stuff, such as throwing stuff at the TV, breading the father’s nose, breaking glasses, throwing cereal on the couch, punching their father in serious areas, etc. Moreover, the video has around 622K views on Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-4.png"                      alt="Children Being Naughty"                ></p><h3 id="5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues"><a href="#5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues" class="headerlink" title="5. Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues"></a>5. <strong>Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues</strong></h3><p>“Simone Biles has withdrawn from the vault and poles finals,” Justin Lee said in the video. “I believe now is a perfect time to offer Auburn trainer Jeff Graba’s description of Biles’ problems.” Everyone who has ever been a gymnast knows that when the twisties are mentioned, everyone comes to a halt. It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died" class="headerlink" title="6. Mr. Big Died"></a>6. <strong>Mr. Big Died</strong></h3><p>The title for this video’s hot viral Twitter reads, “WTF #AndJustLikeThat Mr. Big is no longer alive. I assumed he was having a stroke and wondered why Carrie didn’t call for an ambulance…”.</p><p>This video was posted on December 9, 2021, with around 200K views.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel.

Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died-3"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-3"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-3"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands.

Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion.

Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-2"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-2" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-2"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-2" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-2"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers!

Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-2"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-2" class="headerlink" title="9.

It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134221/18498" target="_top" id="2134221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134221/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort-3"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort-3" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-converting-twitter-video-lyrics-to-custom-gif-animations/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Converting Twitter Video Lyrics to Custom GIF Animations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-emoticon-experts-guide-to-capturing-and-preserving-twitters-gif-images/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Emoticon Expert’s Guide to Capturing and Preserving Twitter's GIF Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-direct-video-sync-from-twitter-to-tumblr-for-2024/"><u>[New] Direct Video Sync From Twitter to Tumblr for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-soundtweetify-quick-audible-maker-for-2024/"><u>[New] SoundTweetify Quick Audible Maker for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-from-vision-to-value-an-all-inclusive-guide-on-analyzing-views-clicks-and-monetization-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Vision to Value An All-Inclusive Guide on Analyzing Views, Clicks, & Monetization for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-boost-productivity-premier-tools-for-unfollowing-tweets/"><u>2024 Approved Boost Productivity Premier Tools for Unfollowing Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-dissecting-the-technical-specifications-of-dji-phantom-3/"><u>2024 Approved Dissecting the Technical Specifications of DJI Phantom 3</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-personalize-your-viewing-experience-building-a-google-cardboard-vr-setup/"><u>2024 Approved Personalize Your Viewing Experience Building a Google Cardboard VR Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/code-28-on-windows-explained-diagnosis-and-repair-tactics-that-work/"><u>Code 28 on Windows Explained: Diagnosis & Repair Tactics That Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/does-find-my-friends-work-on-huawei-nova-y71-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does find my friends work on Huawei Nova Y71 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/how-to-preview-your-web-pages-before-you-upload-them/"><u>How to Preview Your Web Pages Before You Upload Them</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-tweeted-videos-on-facebooks-networks/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Tweeted Videos on Facebooks Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-the-power-of-smart-lock-a-beginners-guide-for-vivo-g2-users-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock A Beginners Guide for Vivo G2 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/maintain-excellent-quality-how-to-turn-your-dvr-files-into-mp4-format/"><u>Maintain Excellent Quality: How to Turn Your DVR Files Into MP4 Format</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Optimizing-Ad-Reach-on-Social-Media’s-Leading-Platform"><a href="#Optimizing-Ad-Reach-on-Social-Media’s-Leading-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Optimizing Ad Reach on Social Media’s Leading Platform"></a>Optimizing Ad Reach on Social Media’s Leading Platform</h2><h1 id="How-to-Advertise-on-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-Advertise-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to Advertise on Twitter"></a>How to Advertise on Twitter</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> A few years after Twitter was launched, the Twitter Ads platform went live. Since 2010 the Twitter’s own advertising platform has enabled countless businesses of all sizes to reach new markets, extend their target audiences and generate profit. From the start, the platform fostered a brand-friendly atmosphere that helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.</p><p> More than half of social media managers think that Twitter is the platform that leads the market in terms of return of investment since 94 percent of the social network’s users have claimed that they planned to buy a product after discovering it on Twitter. In this article, we are going to show you how to advertise on Twitter.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter"><a href="#Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Types of Advertising on Twitter"></a>Types of Advertising on Twitter</h2><p> If your company has reached the decision to start advertising on Twitter, there are three different ways in which you can accomplish this. Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts all offer different opportunities, so let’s take a closer look at each of these options.</p><h4 id="1-Promoted-Accounts"><a href="#1-Promoted-Accounts" class="headerlink" title="1. Promoted Accounts"></a>1. Promoted Accounts</h4><p> As much as 85 percent of users have reported that promoted accounts helped them find new businesses that offer products they were looking for. The true purpose of promoted accounts is to make your Twitter account visible to the audience you targeted and gain more followers in such a manner.</p><p> Promoted accounts appear in timelines of Twitter users that fit in your target group and they also appear in Who to Follow recommendations or search results. If you choose to promote an account you’ll be able to increase its visibility and availability to your potential customers.</p><h4 id="2-Promoted-Tweets"><a href="#2-Promoted-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="2. Promoted Tweets"></a>2. Promoted Tweets</h4><p> Any post you share on Twitter is called a tweet, and a promoted tweet is just the type of tweet a brand paid for so it can reach more people. A promoted tweet is displayed on the user’s timelines, Twitter’s mobile app or high in the search results. You can comment on, retweet or like promoted tweets, which creates a great opportunity to present the services your company offers to Twitter users who don’t follow your account. They also enable you to pick a target group and recommend the products you think they might need.</p><h4 id="3-Promoted-Trends"><a href="#3-Promoted-Trends" class="headerlink" title="3. Promoted Trends"></a>3. Promoted Trends</h4><p> A trend on Twitter is defined as a topic that is most frequently talked about at the moment. You can find the latest trending subjects in the Discover tab on your Twitter account, so using a promoted trend to advertise your brand’s products and services allows you to promote a hashtag at the very top of the Discover tab.</p><p> After someone clicks on the hashtag, they will be able to see a tweet you’re promoting as well as a list of results for the given topic. If people start using that hashtag, more Twitter users will learn about your promoted tweet and enable you to grow the number of your followers organically.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Combining several ad products is the most common method of creating an ad campaign on Twitter, although you can also use a single ad product for the same purpose. These are the types of ad campaigns most frequently used by marketers on Twitter.</p><h4 id="Tweet-Engagements"><a href="#Tweet-Engagements" class="headerlink" title="Tweet Engagements"></a>Tweet Engagements</h4><p> This a simple ad campaign that focuses on increasing the number of people talking about your brand on Twitter. You only have to pay for the first engagement with a user, while all other results of your campaign are free.</p><h4 id="Lead-Generation"><a href="#Lead-Generation" class="headerlink" title="Lead Generation"></a>Lead Generation</h4><p> This service enables you to create Lead Generation cards in Twitter’s ad manager, which contain the user’s email address and their real name as well as their username on the platform. You can download the list of possible leads from your Twitter Ads account.</p><h4 id="Clicks-and-Conversions"><a href="#Clicks-and-Conversions" class="headerlink" title="Clicks and Conversions"></a>Clicks and Conversions</h4><p> This advertising strategy is aimed at driving as much traffic to your website as possible. The service is paid on per click basis, so you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a campaign that isn’t producing results.</p><h4 id="Awareness-and-Followers"><a href="#Awareness-and-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Awareness and Followers"></a>Awareness and Followers</h4><p> If you want to increase the brand awareness, then an awareness campaign is the best solution. This type of campaign presents your profile to an audience you can’t reach and it is the only type of campaign that is based on impressions rather than on engagement rates. Follower campaigns are aimed at increasing the follower base on your Twitter account.</p><h4 id="Fees-and-Payment"><a href="#Fees-and-Payment" class="headerlink" title="Fees and Payment"></a>Fees and Payment</h4><p> Twitter Ads enables you to choose between self-service and full service. If you choose to create your campaign independently you’ll be in charge of the entire process, while the full-service system also includes support from the platform.</p><p> In either case, you will only have to pay for the achieved results, while the rate you’ll pay for each click is determined through the auction system.</p><h2 id="How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Creating a new ad campaign is a simple process that can be completed in just four steps. Here’s how you can set up your first Twitter ad campaign and start enjoying its benefits.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 1"                ></p><p> Open Twitter Ads Manager. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see campaign objectives, select the ones that are most appropriate for your campaign and then click on Create Campaign button. This action will open a new window where you can give a title to your campaign or decide when you want the campaign to start.</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-2.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 2"                ></p><p> In the next step, you will be asked to define your target audience. The platform offers a wide array of targeting options including gender, postal code or language.

Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts all offer different opportunities, so let’s take a closer look at each of these options.</p><h4 id="1-Promoted-Accounts-3"><a href="#1-Promoted-Accounts-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Promoted Accounts"></a>1. Promoted Accounts</h4><p> As much as 85 percent of users have reported that promoted accounts helped them find new businesses that offer products they were looking for. The true purpose of promoted accounts is to make your Twitter account visible to the audience you targeted and gain more followers in such a manner.</p><p> Promoted accounts appear in timelines of Twitter users that fit in your target group and they also appear in Who to Follow recommendations or search results. If you choose to promote an account you’ll be able to increase its visibility and availability to your potential customers.</p><h4 id="2-Promoted-Tweets-3"><a href="#2-Promoted-Tweets-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Promoted Tweets"></a>2. Promoted Tweets</h4><p> Any post you share on Twitter is called a tweet, and a promoted tweet is just the type of tweet a brand paid for so it can reach more people. A promoted tweet is displayed on the user’s timelines, Twitter’s mobile app or high in the search results. You can comment on, retweet or like promoted tweets, which creates a great opportunity to present the services your company offers to Twitter users who don’t follow your account. They also enable you to pick a target group and recommend the products you think they might need.</p><h4 id="3-Promoted-Trends-3"><a href="#3-Promoted-Trends-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Promoted Trends"></a>3. Promoted Trends</h4><p> A trend on Twitter is defined as a topic that is most frequently talked about at the moment. You can find the latest trending subjects in the Discover tab on your Twitter account, so using a promoted trend to advertise your brand’s products and services allows you to promote a hashtag at the very top of the Discover tab.</p><p> After someone clicks on the hashtag, they will be able to see a tweet you’re promoting as well as a list of results for the given topic. If people start using that hashtag, more Twitter users will learn about your promoted tweet and enable you to grow the number of your followers organically.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns-3"><a href="#Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns-3" class="headerlink" title="Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Combining several ad products is the most common method of creating an ad campaign on Twitter, although you can also use a single ad product for the same purpose. These are the types of ad campaigns most frequently used by marketers on Twitter.</p><h4 id="Tweet-Engagements-3"><a href="#Tweet-Engagements-3" class="headerlink" title="Tweet Engagements"></a>Tweet Engagements</h4><p> This a simple ad campaign that focuses on increasing the number of people talking about your brand on Twitter. You only have to pay for the first engagement with a user, while all other results of your campaign are free.</p><h4 id="Lead-Generation-3"><a href="#Lead-Generation-3" class="headerlink" title="Lead Generation"></a>Lead Generation</h4><p> This service enables you to create Lead Generation cards in Twitter’s ad manager, which contain the user’s email address and their real name as well as their username on the platform. You can download the list of possible leads from your Twitter Ads account.</p><h4 id="Clicks-and-Conversions-3"><a href="#Clicks-and-Conversions-3" class="headerlink" title="Clicks and Conversions"></a>Clicks and Conversions</h4><p> This advertising strategy is aimed at driving as much traffic to your website as possible. The service is paid on per click basis, so you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a campaign that isn’t producing results.</p><h4 id="Awareness-and-Followers-3"><a href="#Awareness-and-Followers-3" class="headerlink" title="Awareness and Followers"></a>Awareness and Followers</h4><p> If you want to increase the brand awareness, then an awareness campaign is the best solution.

Follower campaigns are aimed at increasing the follower base on your Twitter account.</p><h4 id="Fees-and-Payment-3"><a href="#Fees-and-Payment-3" class="headerlink" title="Fees and Payment"></a>Fees and Payment</h4><p> Twitter Ads enables you to choose between self-service and full service.
