And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

It decides how long your video will be. As you would have speculated, the aspect ratio can also be used regarding pictures; however, since we’re discussing the video in this article, we won’t deviate to incorporating the aspect ratio for the image.</p><p>● The aspect ratio is written as x:y.</p><p>The 1st number of the aspect ratio refers to the width, while the 2nd number of the aspect ratio refers to the height of the video.</p><p>The videos on Twitter have become the most used content in recent years. The best aspect ratio that should be used in Twitter for videos is 1:2.39 and 2.39:1. You have to make sure that you should go for a higher aspect ratio for videos. Opting higher aspect ratio makes your videos take up more space the engagement of the videos depends upon the visibility of the videos. The higher the visibility, the higher will be the engagement.</p><p>Twitter recommends two aspect ratios for twitter videos.</p><p>● For landscape or portrait, it recommends 16:9.</p><p>For square, it recommends 1:1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-5.jpg"                      alt="twitter video aspect ratio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform"></a>Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform</h2><h3 id="1-Keep-it-short-and-simple"><a href="#1-Keep-it-short-and-simple" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep it short and simple"></a>1. Keep it short and simple</h3><p>Currently, the world is moving fast; therefore, humans can get distracted instantly, grabbing their attention is easy. But if you want to get the real deal, you’ll need to make the initial part of your video attractive enough for them to wait and watch the other part of the video.</p><p>The first 3 seconds of your video should always carry the main message you intended to share. Also, try as much as possible to make videos in less than 15 seconds to maximize branding impact.</p><p>Employ the same strategy for your tweet copy and try to keep it concise and crisp and stay below 100 characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-6.JPG"                      alt="twitter video file size"                ></p><h3 id="2-Include-Product-and-People"><a href="#2-Include-Product-and-People" class="headerlink" title="2. Include Product and People"></a>2. Include Product and People</h3><p>Twitter recommends opening up ads while the product is on focus. This has led to a 34% increase in click intent and a 24% increase in positive interest. Twitter also says that having products with human touch or any association with them resulted in an overall response increase by 40 %.</p><p>So you should ensure that your video has a positive human engagement and desire for the product in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-4.jpg"                      alt="maximum twitter video size"                ></p><h3 id="3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach"><a href="#3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach"></a>3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach</h3><p>Hashtags are very common on Twitter, and you will rarely find videos that do not have hashtags. This feature is very helpful because it helps you classify your videos, making them quick to access.</p><p>Many hashtags might be used on a post, but when it comes to Twitter, less is more. So try to stick to 1-2 important hashtags in your Twitter copy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-3.jpg"                      alt="use trending hashtags for twitter"                ></p><h3 id="4-Flash-that-Logo"><a href="#4-Flash-that-Logo" class="headerlink" title="4. Flash that Logo"></a>4. Flash that Logo</h3><p>Twitter recommends that brands place their logos within their video frame and just immediately at the start of the video to drive brand association from the beginning. When logos are placed evidently, the brand recall will increase by 30%.</p><p>You can also put your logo in the upper right or left-hand corner of your video to increase the chances of the brand recall but make sure it is in a more catchy position.</p><h3 id="5-Include-Captions"><a href="#5-Include-Captions" class="headerlink" title="5. Include Captions"></a>5. Include Captions</h3><p>93% of videos on Twitter are viewed through mobile phones; therefore, it’s important to have a video accompanied by sound. This is because many people use Twitter and other social media when they are on the go, and in some cases, they might not access sound.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to use captions and other forms of text to give your video more context so that the viewers can better understand the context.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-1.jpg"                      alt="add captions in twitter video"                ></p><h3 id="6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool"><a href="#6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool" class="headerlink" title="6.

As a result, Twitter feeds are full of brands and marketers strictly uploading links to their websites for marketing purposes.</p><p>However, some top brands do not allow broadcasting messages on their sites. But if you aim to develop your audience or use Twitter for roles other than brand messaging, you have to engage.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>There are approximately 330 million active users on Twitter each month; with such a big number, your organic post might easily get lost in the crowd. So, selling video ads as an investment should consider getting your brand to the next level. On the other hand, ensure that you follow all the required video specifications for each Twitter video.

It decides how long your video will be. As you would have speculated, the aspect ratio can also be used regarding pictures; however, since we’re discussing the video in this article, we won’t deviate to incorporating the aspect ratio for the image.</p><p>● The aspect ratio is written as x:y.</p><p>The 1st number of the aspect ratio refers to the width, while the 2nd number of the aspect ratio refers to the height of the video.</p><p>The videos on Twitter have become the most used content in recent years. The best aspect ratio that should be used in Twitter for videos is 1:2.39 and 2.39:1. You have to make sure that you should go for a higher aspect ratio for videos. Opting higher aspect ratio makes your videos take up more space the engagement of the videos depends upon the visibility of the videos. The higher the visibility, the higher will be the engagement.</p><p>Twitter recommends two aspect ratios for twitter videos.</p><p>● For landscape or portrait, it recommends 16:9.</p><p>For square, it recommends 1:1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-5.jpg"                      alt="twitter video aspect ratio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform-3"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform"></a>Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform</h2><h3 id="1-Keep-it-short-and-simple-3"><a href="#1-Keep-it-short-and-simple-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

But if you want to get the real deal, you’ll need to make the initial part of your video attractive enough for them to wait and watch the other part of the video.</p><p>The first 3 seconds of your video should always carry the main message you intended to share. Also, try as much as possible to make videos in less than 15 seconds to maximize branding impact.</p><p>Employ the same strategy for your tweet copy and try to keep it concise and crisp and stay below 100 characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-6.JPG"                      alt="twitter video file size"                ></p><h3 id="2-Include-Product-and-People-3"><a href="#2-Include-Product-and-People-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

This has led to a 34% increase in click intent and a 24% increase in positive interest. Twitter also says that having products with human touch or any association with them resulted in an overall response increase by 40 %.</p><p>So you should ensure that your video has a positive human engagement and desire for the product in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-4.jpg"                      alt="maximum twitter video size"                ></p><h3 id="3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach-3"><a href="#3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

This feature is very helpful because it helps you classify your videos, making them quick to access.</p><p>Many hashtags might be used on a post, but when it comes to Twitter, less is more. So try to stick to 1-2 important hashtags in your Twitter copy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-3.jpg"                      alt="use trending hashtags for twitter"                ></p><h3 id="4-Flash-that-Logo-3"><a href="#4-Flash-that-Logo-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

When logos are placed evidently, the brand recall will increase by 30%.</p><p>You can also put your logo in the upper right or left-hand corner of your video to increase the chances of the brand recall but make sure it is in a more catchy position.</p><h3 id="5-Include-Captions-3"><a href="#5-Include-Captions-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Include Captions"></a>5. Include Captions</h3><p>93% of videos on Twitter are viewed through mobile phones; therefore, it’s important to have a video accompanied by sound. This is because many people use Twitter and other social media when they are on the go, and in some cases, they might not access sound.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to use captions and other forms of text to give your video more context so that the viewers can better understand the context.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-1.jpg"                      alt="add captions in twitter video"                ></p><h3 id="6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool-3"><a href="#6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

As a result, Twitter feeds are full of brands and marketers strictly uploading links to their websites for marketing purposes.</p><p>However, some top brands do not allow broadcasting messages on their sites.

So, selling video ads as an investment should consider getting your brand to the next level. On the other hand, ensure that you follow all the required video specifications for each Twitter video. This is because the last thing you want is an attractive video that cannot be posted. After all, it has the wrong aspect ratio for Twitter video or wrong Twitter video file size. In this case, you need Filmora to resize your videos easily.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

Since 2010 the Twitter’s own advertising platform has enabled countless businesses of all sizes to reach new markets, extend their target audiences and generate profit. From the start, the platform fostered a brand-friendly atmosphere that helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.</p><p> More than half of social media managers think that Twitter is the platform that leads the market in terms of return of investment since 94 percent of the social network’s users have claimed that they planned to buy a product after discovering it on Twitter. In this article, we are going to show you how to advertise on Twitter.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter"><a href="#Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Types of Advertising on Twitter"></a>Types of Advertising on Twitter</h2><p> If your company has reached the decision to start advertising on Twitter, there are three different ways in which you can accomplish this. Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts all offer different opportunities, so let’s take a closer look at each of these options.</p><h4 id="1-Promoted-Accounts"><a href="#1-Promoted-Accounts" class="headerlink" title="1. Promoted Accounts"></a>1. Promoted Accounts</h4><p> As much as 85 percent of users have reported that promoted accounts helped them find new businesses that offer products they were looking for. The true purpose of promoted accounts is to make your Twitter account visible to the audience you targeted and gain more followers in such a manner.</p><p> Promoted accounts appear in timelines of Twitter users that fit in your target group and they also appear in Who to Follow recommendations or search results. If you choose to promote an account you’ll be able to increase its visibility and availability to your potential customers.</p><h4 id="2-Promoted-Tweets"><a href="#2-Promoted-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="2. Promoted Tweets"></a>2. Promoted Tweets</h4><p> Any post you share on Twitter is called a tweet, and a promoted tweet is just the type of tweet a brand paid for so it can reach more people. A promoted tweet is displayed on the user’s timelines, Twitter’s mobile app or high in the search results. You can comment on, retweet or like promoted tweets, which creates a great opportunity to present the services your company offers to Twitter users who don’t follow your account. They also enable you to pick a target group and recommend the products you think they might need.</p><h4 id="3-Promoted-Trends"><a href="#3-Promoted-Trends" class="headerlink" title="3. Promoted Trends"></a>3. Promoted Trends</h4><p> A trend on Twitter is defined as a topic that is most frequently talked about at the moment. You can find the latest trending subjects in the Discover tab on your Twitter account, so using a promoted trend to advertise your brand’s products and services allows you to promote a hashtag at the very top of the Discover tab.</p><p> After someone clicks on the hashtag, they will be able to see a tweet you’re promoting as well as a list of results for the given topic. If people start using that hashtag, more Twitter users will learn about your promoted tweet and enable you to grow the number of your followers organically.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Combining several ad products is the most common method of creating an ad campaign on Twitter, although you can also use a single ad product for the same purpose. These are the types of ad campaigns most frequently used by marketers on Twitter.</p><h4 id="Tweet-Engagements"><a href="#Tweet-Engagements" class="headerlink" title="Tweet Engagements"></a>Tweet Engagements</h4><p> This a simple ad campaign that focuses on increasing the number of people talking about your brand on Twitter. You only have to pay for the first engagement with a user, while all other results of your campaign are free.</p><h4 id="Lead-Generation"><a href="#Lead-Generation" class="headerlink" title="Lead Generation"></a>Lead Generation</h4><p> This service enables you to create Lead Generation cards in Twitter’s ad manager, which contain the user’s email address and their real name as well as their username on the platform. You can download the list of possible leads from your Twitter Ads account.</p><h4 id="Clicks-and-Conversions"><a href="#Clicks-and-Conversions" class="headerlink" title="Clicks and Conversions"></a>Clicks and Conversions</h4><p> This advertising strategy is aimed at driving as much traffic to your website as possible. The service is paid on per click basis, so you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a campaign that isn’t producing results.</p><h4 id="Awareness-and-Followers"><a href="#Awareness-and-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Awareness and Followers"></a>Awareness and Followers</h4><p> If you want to increase the brand awareness, then an awareness campaign is the best solution. This type of campaign presents your profile to an audience you can’t reach and it is the only type of campaign that is based on impressions rather than on engagement rates. Follower campaigns are aimed at increasing the follower base on your Twitter account.</p><h4 id="Fees-and-Payment"><a href="#Fees-and-Payment" class="headerlink" title="Fees and Payment"></a>Fees and Payment</h4><p> Twitter Ads enables you to choose between self-service and full service. If you choose to create your campaign independently you’ll be in charge of the entire process, while the full-service system also includes support from the platform.</p><p> In either case, you will only have to pay for the achieved results, while the rate you’ll pay for each click is determined through the auction system.</p><h2 id="How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Creating a new ad campaign is a simple process that can be completed in just four steps. Here’s how you can set up your first Twitter ad campaign and start enjoying its benefits.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 1"                ></p><p> Open Twitter Ads Manager. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see campaign objectives, select the ones that are most appropriate for your campaign and then click on Create Campaign button. This action will open a new window where you can give a title to your campaign or decide when you want the campaign to start.</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-2.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 2"                ></p><p> In the next step, you will be asked to define your target audience. The platform offers a wide array of targeting options including gender, postal code or language. Twitter Ads offers support through the process, so you can maximize efficiency and reduce the costs of the campaign.</p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-3.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 3"                ></p><p> Once you’ve defined the target audience as precisely as possible, you can move on to set your budget. By setting the financial limit to your campaign you can control how much you are spending on ads on a daily basis.</p><h4 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-4.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 4"                ></p><p> At the end of the ad campaign setup, you will be asked to select a tweet you want to promote. The platform provides a list of tweets that already exist, but you can also insert the tweet your marketing team has created. You can also upload media, before hitting the Publish Tweet button and starting your new Twitter Ad campaign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison-1"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison-1" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> A few years after Twitter was launched, the Twitter Ads platform went live.

However, even if each platform has its own vibe, it’s also true that content going viral on one platform will most likely be adored on the other platform as well.</p><p>This article will teach you how to share a Twitter video on Instagram and Instagram story. You can post on Twitter and Facebook together with one click and save a lot of time.</p><h2 id="Importance-of-Posting-Across-Multiple-Platforms"><a href="#Importance-of-Posting-Across-Multiple-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Posting Across Multiple Platforms"></a>Importance of Posting Across Multiple Platforms</h2><p>If you are new to social media or simply new to blogging, then this article will guide you on how to post your content on Twitter and Instagram simultaneously. Even while scrolling, if you come across an exciting video that you would like to post on your Instagram you can easily do that using one of the methods below. But, why would one want to post the same post on Twitter and then on Instagram?</p><h3 id="Reach-a-Wider-Audience"><a href="#Reach-a-Wider-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Reach a Wider Audience"></a>Reach a Wider Audience</h3><p>Your friends on multiple platforms might not be the same, with each social media having its own style. Posting a video from Twitter to Instagram might reach an entirely different audience than Twitter with the varying algorithms. This will help reach a larger audience, and people can enjoy your content on any social media app.</p><h3 id="Social-Media-Strategy"><a href="#Social-Media-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Social Media Strategy"></a>Social Media Strategy</h3><p>Cross-posting is a very effective social media strategy that allows you to streamline your content and repurpose your content across all platforms. This will increase brand awareness and ensure people view your content and don’t miss out on it.</p><h3 id="Keeps-Social-Media-Up-to-Date"><a href="#Keeps-Social-Media-Up-to-Date" class="headerlink" title="Keeps Social Media Up to Date"></a>Keeps Social Media Up to Date</h3><p>Cross posting also helps in keeping all social media up to date.

This makes Instagram also more photo and video-friendly.</p><p>Now that you are familiar with all the benefits of cross-posting Twitter videos to Instagram, you can learn how to do that in quick and easy steps.</p><p>Instagram stories are also a very interactive feature that allow you to post content that will stay on your profile for just 24 hours and then get deleted automatically. You can post your Twitter video on Instagram stories if you don’t want to post the video permanently on your profile. Here is how you can post Twitter videos on Instagram stories:</p><h3 id="1-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Instagram-Story-Chrome"><a href="#1-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Instagram-Story-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="1. Share Twitter Videos on Instagram Story Chrome"></a>1. Share Twitter Videos on Instagram Story Chrome</h3><p>While you always have the option of posting the Twitter video link on your Instagram story, this is not the same as posting as video. The link will lead them back to Twitter to watch the video, and people rarely open links to watch something. This means that you might have to post the actual video on your stories, and here is how you can do that.</p><p>If you are using chrome and your PC to access Twitter and Instagram, then open your browser.</p><ul><li>Open Twitter and login with your credentials.</li><li>Locate the video from your Newsfeed. If you have retweeted the video, then you can find it under the media tab of your Profile.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-video-on-instagram-1.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Once you locate the video, right-click on the video, and from the menu, select “Copy Video Address”. This will copy the video URL to the PC’s clipboard.</li><li>You need to download the video with a video downloading website like <a class="link"   href="https://twittervideodownloader.com/" >Twitter Video Downloader <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Open Twitter video Downloader in a New Tab.</li><li>Now, paste the copied video URL into the URL box on the top of the screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-video-on-instagram-2.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Then click Download. This will allow the website to locate the video and convert it.</li><li>You can set your output format to mp4 and click on Download to download the video to your device.</li><li>Once you have downloaded the video, the next step is uploading it. Log into your Instagram in another tab.</li><li>Now to view your Instagram in mobile mode from your PC, click on the three dots just under the close button for chrome. This will open the view menu.</li><li>From the view menu, select More Tools and then click on Developer tools. You can also use the shortcut: <strong>Crtl+ Shift + J</strong>for Windows and <strong>Command+ Options+J</strong> for Mac.</li><li>Once the Developer Tools window opens, you will see two little icons on the top right.

Now click on the little icon at the bottom of the screen in a little “+” sign beside the magnifying glass icon. This icon will allow you to create a new post or story.</li><li>Tap on the “Story” option from the bottom of the screen to create a new Instagram story.</li><li>Now select the video you want to post. You can add captions, stickers, or emojis to add some glamor.</li><li>Lastly, click on Your Story from the bottom of the screen to post it to your Instagram Story.</li></ul><p>And you are done!

In addition to videos, Filmora allows you to import images or music, as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-3.png"                      alt="Import your media files to Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>● Step 2: Place files on the video track</strong></p><p>Now, record your reaction video and import it to the editor as well. You need to place the Tweet video or image on the video track and then place your reaction video directly above it. The top video should be in a larger size so make sure to adjust its size by clicking on the video and opening it in the preview. Now, drag the handles inward or outward to position the video.</p><p><strong>● Step 3: Use editing tools</strong></p><p>There are over 60 motion effects, numerous transitions, and visual effects to add flair and appeal to your reaction video. These editing tools will make your video attractive and help it stand out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-4.png"                      alt="choose from a wide selection of editing tools"                ></p><p>You can use its blending modes to control the opacity of the Tweet image or video you’re reacting to.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Making-Good-Twitter-Reaction-Videos"><a href="#Tips-for-Making-Good-Twitter-Reaction-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Making Good Twitter Reaction Videos"></a>Tips for Making Good Twitter Reaction Videos</h2><p>Reaction videos gain tremendous traction, but let’s be honest - they’re not always that exciting to watch. A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable"><a href="#●-Be-relatable" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body"><a href="#●-Use-your-body" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects"><a href="#●-Use-effects" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life.

However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything-3"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything-3" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-3"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-3" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-3"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body-3"><a href="#●-Use-your-body-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music-3"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music-3" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects-3"><a href="#●-Use-effects-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip. And, that’s why using the Filmora video editor is a valuable choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular

Videos are chosen by a significant majority of people on all social media platforms. But why is this the case?</p><p>Consumers favor videos because they are simple to consume, grasp, and comprehend. In contrast, video producers prefer videos because they know that their content is available to everyone with an internet connection.</p><p>Twitter also keeps up with the times. In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a ‘renowned’ Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.</p><p>To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 <strong>Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</strong>. Let’s dive in.</p><h2 id="What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’"><a href="#What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’" class="headerlink" title="What is ‘Most Viewed?’"></a>What is ‘Most Viewed?’</h2><p>Even though this is hardly rocket science for many, some people continue to conflate the terms’ most watched’ and ‘viral.’ So, what is it that distinguishes the worlds of the two? It’s as easy as the number of views!</p><p>When a video is deemed the ‘most viewed,’ it means that it is currently leading the pack in terms of the number of people who have seen it compared to all other videos on the platform.</p><h2 id="10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter"></a>10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</h2><h3 id="1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz"><a href="#1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz" class="headerlink" title="1. Messi’s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz"></a>1. <strong>Messi’s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz</strong></h3><p>This is the most viewed twitter video of 2022. This video’s caption says, “Lionel still needs to explain how he did this.” This video was posted on January 25, 2022, with around 4.7M views in just two days. This video features Filipe Luiz of Atletico de Madrid getting nutmegged by Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona. Nutmeg is the term used when a ball goes through the legs of the player.

Ozark is an official Netflix TV series that debuted in 2013.</p><p>It is a crime television drama written by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams and created by MRC.

The Byrdes and their teenage children, Charlotte and Jonah, are, for the most part, an average family living an ordinary life.</p><p>In the teaser, Marty, and Wendy attempt to negotiate an immunity agreement between Navarro and the FBI. Marty’s conflict with Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) worsens. The last season has 14 episodes, divided into two parts of seven each.

Although we didn’t intend to include the “fun” genre on our list, we couldn’t help but include this one since we did not want to let this one slip between the cracks.</p><p>We think it’s pretty amusing. That might not be the case for you if you were in the position of the bald man who had his face smacked with the ball kicked by the small youngster standing next to him. While this may sound hazardous or unpleasant, we promise you will have a good chuckle and come away with a different point of view after watching it.</p><p>The video was shared on Twitter today by the LADbible’s account, and it seems to have been seen by as many as 1 million people thus far. That was lightning-fast. And you can pretty much guarantee that this video will continue to gain popularity and get another couple of million views in no time!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-9.png"                      alt="&#39;AVE IT!&#39; by LADbible"                ></p><h3 id="10-Ronaldo-Playing-Football-with-A-Boy-Without-Legs-3"><a href="#10-Ronaldo-Playing-Football-with-A-Boy-Without-Legs-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

It was uploaded on January 25, 2022, with around 894K views.</p><p>Cristiano Ronaldo, a Portuguese International and Manchester United (England) footballer, is considered one of the greatest footballers ever. He has previously played for Sporting Club de Portugal (Portugal), Real Madrid (Spain), and Juventus (Italy). Ronaldo also has the most international goals in the history of football. He is a six-time Ballon D’or and FIFA THE BEST award winner five times. He is undoubtedly the deadliest striker of this generation.</p><p>Even after achieving the great bound of success, he is humble and understands the emotions of his fans, and this video is the perfect example of that humbleness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-10.png"                      alt="Ronaldo Playing Football with A Boy Without Legs"                ></p><h2 id="Summary-Table-3"><a href="#Summary-Table-3" class="headerlink" title="Summary Table"></a>Summary Table</h2><table><thead><tr><th>1. <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/idoknowball/status/1486018635579953157" >Messi’s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></th><th>The ball was in the air, and Messi nutmegs him by just turning around.

The company wants to ensure that both services are integrated to the benefit of users who want to broadcast or watch this type of live content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/periscope-twitter.JPG"                      alt="periscope twitter"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-Twitter-and-Periscope-Work-Together-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-Twitter-and-Periscope-Work-Together-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do Twitter and Periscope Work Together?"></a>Part 2: How Do Twitter and Periscope Work Together?</h2><p> If you are hoping to start a live streaming video broadcast, you can get the process rolling within your Twitter app. On both Android and iOS devices, you may go to the compose tweet button, and then select the icon that looks like a video record notification.</p><p> An interesting aspect of the Periscope Twitter integration is that when you start a live video on Twitter, it is accessible on both platforms. People who are on Twitter and wanting to see live videos can search for your video. And the same is true on the Periscope app and website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/periscope-twitter-work.JPG"                      alt="periscope twitter work together"                ></p><p> Alternatively, you could start your live video on the Periscope app. It is entirely your choice. But we find that most users would rather do this through Twitter, especially if that is the social media app you are usually accessing for posts or consuming content.</p><p> It is possible to share your past broadcasts as a tweet, direct message or by copying the link and sending it to someone’s email address.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Q-A-on-Twitter-Live-Streaming-and-Periscope-3"><a href="#Part-3-Q-A-on-Twitter-Live-Streaming-and-Periscope-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Q&amp;A on Twitter Live Streaming and Periscope"></a>Part 3: Q&amp;A on Twitter Live Streaming and Periscope</h2><h4 id="1-How-Can-I-Tweet-Out-My-Broadcast-3"><a href="#1-How-Can-I-Tweet-Out-My-Broadcast-3" class="headerlink" title="1. How Can I Tweet Out My Broadcast?"></a>1. How Can I Tweet Out My Broadcast?</h4><p> You have just started your broadcast through the Twitter app, and you want to share it as a tweet on peoples’ timelines. All you need to do is press the “share live” button, and you are all set. You can send it out as a tweet, direct message or as a link. The same applies to videos that are complete, as they save automatically on the cloud.</p><h4 id="2-Can-I-Open-Periscope-Videos-through-Twitter-3"><a href="#2-Can-I-Open-Periscope-Videos-through-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Can I Open Periscope Videos through Twitter?"></a>2. Can I Open Periscope Videos through Twitter?</h4><p> Yes, if you are hoping to watch a live video in Periscope, you can open it through the Twitter app. When you find the video, swipe to open the options menu. It will allow you to open the video in Periscope. You must swipe right if you are on the iOS platform, and swipe up on Android devices.</p><h4 id="3-What-Are-Periscope-Live-360-Videos-3"><a href="#3-What-Are-Periscope-Live-360-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3. What Are Periscope Live 360 Videos?"></a>3. What Are Periscope Live 360 Videos?</h4><p> Live 360 videos are captured using special devices or cameras, where you get an entire 360 degree view of the stream. If you are using a device that has VR capability, such as Samsung smartphones, you can view the 360 degree video through your Gear VR headset. It is also watchable with Google Cardboard.</p><p> If you are using a regular smartphone and you do not have a VR headset, you can simply use your fingers to move around the 360 degree video to access different viewpoints. Creating 360 degree videos is a different matter, as the feature is only available to select partners through Periscope.</p><h4 id="4-Can-I-Block-Live-Streaming-Viewers-Through-Twitter-3"><a href="#4-Can-I-Block-Live-Streaming-Viewers-Through-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Can I Block Live Streaming Viewers Through Twitter?"></a>4. Can I Block Live Streaming Viewers Through Twitter?</h4><p> If you do not appreciate certain users watching your live videos, or you are unhappy with the comments they are posting, you may block them through the app. Simply click on their comment, go onto their profile, and use the regular means of blocking the person. That user will be unable to watch or comment on your videos, or access anything related to your profile. They cannot see any of your tweets either.</p><h2 id="Concluison-3"><a href="#Concluison-3" class="headerlink" title="Concluison"></a>Concluison</h2><p> The Twitter live stream feature is designed with users in mind. With the acquisition of Periscope, Twitter had the chance to merge its live videos with an already popular platform. If you are hoping to showcase a live video to the world, or your followers, you can get it started through your Twitter account.</p><p> And when you do start a live video, it is seen and accessible on both Twitter and Periscope. If you add a location to the live video, it is even visible on the Periscope global map of live videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

No, the idea is not to copy the Twitter videos, Tiktok Viral clips and do something you do not want to do. Instead, you can take inspiration from these popular TikTok videos viral on Twitter and know what makes a clip popular among the users.</p><p>Most people think that making videos on TikTok is easy and superficial. After all, the videos, on average, are about 10 seconds long. But upon downloading the application, you will soon start feeling lost. Those 10 seconds become the hardest to shoot. And why not? Millions of people globally are competing to create something new, simple, and creative, something that not only engages the audience but also forces them to rewatch, like, share, and comment on the clip.</p><p>Wann’ know how to create something simple yet trend-worthy on TikTok? Take inspiration from these top ten TikTok viral videos that rule Twitter in 2022.</p><h2 id="1-Zach-King’s-Harry-Potter-doing-the-laundry"><a href="#1-Zach-King’s-Harry-Potter-doing-the-laundry" class="headerlink" title="1.

With over 2.8 Billion views, Zach King flying on a broom is the most-watched video on TikTok. And for a reason: be it the caption or video, every second of it is enough to awe the user.</p><p>Zach currently has over 66 Million followers on TikTok, and a hefty number of followers came after his enthralling Harry Potter video with the caption: “They rejected my application to Hogwarts, but I still found a way to be a wizard.”</p><p>In the video, Zach is flying on the broom in the first part, whereas the second part reveals the illusion. Zach can be seen with a mirror and a fake leg hanging on it, and he is moving on a skateboard. So, there you go! A little bit of cleverness and the shame of having to reveal your trick is all it takes to make your video the most-watched video on TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/zachking/status/1204490381200506880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1204698987325837313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2019/12/11/incredible-harry-potter-broom-trick/" >Zach King’s Harry Potter Illusion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones"><a href="#2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones" class="headerlink" title="2.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content. The lesson to learn here is although a clip of mere seconds, creators should put effort and time and really feel like shooting a real movie. And only when you shoot videos with this kind of spirit expect them to go viral.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@totouchanemu/video/6990181852803894533?is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6981905548543346181" >David Allen Dancing with Drones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”"><a href="#3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”" class="headerlink" title="3.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings" class="headerlink" title="4.

And Franek Bielak uses the platform just for that. Show his talent: drawings. One of the top influencers (of his realm) on TikTok, Franek Biekal’s “This is one of my best drawings” video, is one of the most liked videos on the platform with over 44 million likes. The video pleads users continuously with messages like “Please watch till the end,” “Is worth it,” and Franek shows the drawing process with a low rhythm playing in the background.</p><p>If you are good at something, TikTok can indeed make you famous. But note that Franke shared a lot of his drawings before reaping the rewards via this one. And the reason to attach Franek to this Twitter video viral TikTok 2022 list is to motivate you to share your talents with the users on TikTok and not lose hope.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fredziownik%5Fart/video/6911406868699073798?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6919038900356089349&is_from_webapp=v3&is_copy_url=0" >Franek Bielak Drawings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="5-Billie-Eilish’s-first-TikTok-video"><a href="#5-Billie-Eilish’s-first-TikTok-video" class="headerlink" title="5.

And for a reason: be it the caption or video, every second of it is enough to awe the user.</p><p>Zach currently has over 66 Million followers on TikTok, and a hefty number of followers came after his enthralling Harry Potter video with the caption: “They rejected my application to Hogwarts, but I still found a way to be a wizard.”</p><p>In the video, Zach is flying on the broom in the first part, whereas the second part reveals the illusion. Zach can be seen with a mirror and a fake leg hanging on it, and he is moving on a skateboard. So, there you go! A little bit of cleverness and the shame of having to reveal your trick is all it takes to make your video the most-watched video on TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/zachking/status/1204490381200506880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1204698987325837313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2019/12/11/incredible-harry-potter-broom-trick/" >Zach King’s Harry Potter Illusion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones-1"><a href="#2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content. The lesson to learn here is although a clip of mere seconds, creators should put effort and time and really feel like shooting a real movie.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-1"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

With over 2.8 Billion views, Zach King flying on a broom is the most-watched video on TikTok. And for a reason: be it the caption or video, every second of it is enough to awe the user.</p><p>Zach currently has over 66 Million followers on TikTok, and a hefty number of followers came after his enthralling Harry Potter video with the caption: “They rejected my application to Hogwarts, but I still found a way to be a wizard.”</p><p>In the video, Zach is flying on the broom in the first part, whereas the second part reveals the illusion. Zach can be seen with a mirror and a fake leg hanging on it, and he is moving on a skateboard. So, there you go! A little bit of cleverness and the shame of having to reveal your trick is all it takes to make your video the most-watched video on TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/zachking/status/1204490381200506880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1204698987325837313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2019/12/11/incredible-harry-potter-broom-trick/" >Zach King’s Harry Potter Illusion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones-2"><a href="#2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Videos are one of the most engaging and eye-catching sources of information. Human nature prefers an easy and convenient way to get the required information such as videos instead of reading an entire article or post. Unfortunately, there is a common problem of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome for most Twitter users. There can so many distinct reasons that might be causing such a problem. If you are the one who is facing the issue of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, then this article is for you. By following the methods discussed in this article, the videos will start to auto-play while you scroll through the Twitter Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gif-from-twitter.gif"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There could be so many reasons for Twitter videos not playing in Chrome.

Twitter only supports MP4 video format and A64 audio format. If any video on Twitter doesn’t have such a format, it will not play. If only a few Twitter videos are not playing in Chrome but most of the videos are playing, this might be the problem with those videos. The best way o watch those videos is to download them using a third-party downloading platform.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Flash-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Flash-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Flash for Twitter"></a>Flash for Twitter</h4></li></ol><p>If you have checked the above aspect and it is not the case with your Twitter videos and non of the video is playing, you should try enabling the flash for Twitter. If the flash is not enabled in your Chrome browser, it will not play videos. To enable flash for Twitter, after visiting Twitter, click on the ‘Lock’ icon placed on the left side of the address bar and go to ‘Site Settings.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix2.jpg"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix2"                ></p><p>In the window of settings, you will find flash in this list. Click the drop-down in front of flash and select ‘Allow’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix3.png"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix3"                ></p><p>This will allow Twitter to use flash to play videos.

The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones.

This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1.

The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration.

That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4.

Purchase intent rises by 34% when videos are shared on Twitter. In truth, Twitter is about far more than 280 characters: it’s about telling a narrative, your story.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, we’ll still go through the Twitter video criteria for each of them, as well as some best practices for increasing interaction. It’s critical to understand the proper Twitter video specifications, such as the maximum size limit, format, and aspect ratios. By keeping an eye out for things like these, you can guarantee <strong>how to post videos on Twitter</strong> in the best possible form for a better watching experience.</p><ul><li>Never exceed a frame of 30 frames per second. Although Twitter can accept files with a frame rate of 40 frames per second, limiting your video to 30 frames per second will ensure cross-channel compatibility.</li></ul><h2 id="1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC"><a href="#1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC" class="headerlink" title="1.

Post Videos on Twitter from IOS App</h2><p>After testing the capability last month, Twitter has finally made it possible for Android and iOS users to post 4K videos. People will be able to share high-resolution photos on Twitter as a result of this. Fleets, Twitter’s counterpart of Instagram Stories that vanishes, now has a new function. You may now upload a photo or video from your phone’s gallery to a Fleet. This is now only accessible for iOS users, but Android users should get it shortly.</p><ul><li>Launch Twitter</li></ul><p>On your iOS smartphone, open the Twitter app from your Home and click on the Tweet button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/upload-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="upload videos"                ></p><ul><li>Open Tweet settings</li></ul><p>To access the settings, tap the menu and select the video caption as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/upload-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="upload videos"                ></p><ul><li>Select Data Usage</li></ul><p>Scroll down to the Data Usage section.

This isn’t to say that you won’t be able to complete the task. All you have to do now is be creative with the tools you do have. When making, modifying, and publishing videos to Twitter, whether on a smartphone or a computer, keep these <strong>best formats for Twitter videos</strong> in mind. They’re important for a pleasant user experience and the success of your profile. If all of the above seems like too much trouble, you can always hire someone to perform the task for you. There are plenty of firms that can make videos that get your brand recognized, in the right file format, and optimized to meet all of Twitter’s video requirements.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Twitter is an internationally renowned online news and social networking platform.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-2"><a href="#In-this-article-2" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-2"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7. Video bitrate limit on Twitter</strong></p><p>Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Specifications for Twitter"></a>Best Video Specifications for Twitter</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Best Format Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1280x720, 720x1280, 720x720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 or 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Minimum)</strong></td><td>5000 kbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Maximum)</strong></td><td>128 kbps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With video consumption increasing year after year, Twitter video helps you to remain current and attract an audience that values video content for knowledge. Purchase intent rises by 34% when videos are shared on Twitter. In truth, Twitter is about far more than 280 characters: it’s about telling a narrative, your story.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?"></a>Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?</h2><p>Both Twitter In-feed videos and Twitter video advertising have comparable video specs, which is fortunate for you. However, we’ll still go through the Twitter video criteria for each of them, as well as some best practices for increasing interaction. It’s critical to understand the proper Twitter video specifications, such as the maximum size limit, format, and aspect ratios. By keeping an eye out for things like these, you can guarantee <strong>how to post videos on Twitter</strong> in the best possible form for a better watching experience.</p><ul><li>Never exceed a frame of 30 frames per second. Although Twitter can accept files with a frame rate of 40 frames per second, limiting your video to 30 frames per second will ensure cross-channel compatibility.</li></ul><h2 id="1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC-3"><a href="#1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Post Videos on Twitter from IOS App</h2><p>After testing the capability last month, Twitter has finally made it possible for Android and iOS users to post 4K videos. People will be able to share high-resolution photos on Twitter as a result of this. Fleets, Twitter’s counterpart of Instagram Stories that vanishes, now has a new function. You may now upload a photo or video from your phone’s gallery to a Fleet. This is now only accessible for iOS users, but Android users should get it shortly.</p><ul><li>Launch Twitter</li></ul><p>On your iOS smartphone, open the Twitter app from your Home and click on the Tweet button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/upload-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="upload videos"                ></p><ul><li>Open Tweet settings</li></ul><p>To access the settings, tap the menu and select the video caption as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/upload-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="upload videos"                ></p><ul><li>Select Data Usage</li></ul><p>Scroll down to the Data Usage section.

But, that utilizes the auto-share feature that automatically shares everything you post on Twitter to all your other social media. But nobody really wants to do that.</p><p>That’s why we are here to teach you to the manual method of sharing videos and how you can post a video from Twitter to Facebook. This way, you can share all your favorite tweets and videos from Twitter to Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h2><p>There are multiple ways to post your Twitter videos on your Facebook account without linking the accounts together. We have listed three ways to do that. So, let’s begin:</p><h3 id="1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h3><p>While scrolling through your Twitter feed, if you encounter a fascinating video and want to share it with your Facebook friends, then follow the steps below. The only way to share a video manually from Twitter to Facebook is by copying the link of the video.</p><p>If you have not used this method before, do not worry. We will guide you through it.</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure you have the Twitter video opened in front of you, and you have also logged into your Facebook account.</li><li>Now open the video you want to share and from the upper right corner, click on the downward-facing arrow.</li><li>This will show you three options “<strong>Copy Link To Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>Embed Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>I Don’t like this Tweet</strong>”. Select “<strong>Copy Link to Tweet</strong>”.</li><li>Now a window will open showing the link of the Tweet. You can select the link and copy it.</li><li>Next, open your Facebook page, and from the newsfeed area, <strong>Create a New Post</strong>.</li><li>Post the link of the video in the “<strong>Create a New Post Area</strong>” Once you paste the link, Facebook will find the video and load it to your post. You can preview it too before posting.</li><li>You can also type in a caption for the video and just click post to post your video.</li></ul><p>This is the easiest and most direct way to post a video from Twitter to Facebook. However, if you do not want to use the direct method for some reason, there are multiple indirect methods to post Twitter videos to Facebook.</p><h3 id="2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website"><a href="#2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website" class="headerlink" title="2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website"></a>2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website</h3><p>There are multiple sites on the internet that can help you download a Twitter video and then post it. Given below are two websites you can use to download videos. So, let’s dive in:</p><ul><li>Log into your Twitter account and open your Newsfeed on your PC.</li><li>Locate the video you want to share on Facebook. If you found the video in your newsfeed, you can look for it there.</li><li>In case you retweeted the video, you can find the video on your profile. Click on the Profile symbol, and from the dropdown menu, select Profile. Now click on the Media tab from the top of your profile and look for the video.</li><li>Once you find the video, open it and click on Play to start playing the video.</li><li>Right-click on the video next, and from the menu, select Copy Video Address. This will copy the link for the video so you can paste it wherever you want.</li><li>Now open another tab in your browser and open the <a class="link"   href="https://twdown.net/in" >TwDown <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> This website allows you to download Twitter videos and recordings easily.</li><li>Once you open the website, click on the URL textbox and paste the link you copied.</li><li>Wait for the website to find the video and load it. Once loaded, you can download it by clicking on Download Link.</li><li>This will open your video in a new tab, and you can click on the Download symbol to Download the video.</li><li>Once the video is downloaded, you can post it to Facebook.</li><li>Log into your Facebook account and open your Newsfeed. You will find the Create a New Post Text Box on the top.</li><li>Click on the Add a Video icon to add a new video.</li><li>Locate the video on your PC and click Open to add it to your post.</li><li>Now, write an appropriate caption to match your video and click on Post.</li></ul><p>And voila!

Download a Twitter Video with the sssTwitter website and Post it on Facebook"></a>3. Download a Twitter Video with the sssTwitter website and Post it on Facebook</h3><p>Another way to download and post a video from Twitter to Facebook is using the sssTwitter website. Here is how you can download and post the video:</p><ul><li>Now log into your Twitter account and find the video you want to share on Facebook.</li><li>Make sure you do not tap on the video and only snap the tweet to grow it.</li><li>In the URL box on top of your tab, carefully edit your URL address. Add “sss” before Twitter. For example, if it looked like “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/%5Blink" >https://twitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]” before, make sure it looks like “<a class="link"   href="https://ssstwitter.com/%5Blink" >https://ssstwitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]”</li><li>Now Press Enter. This will take you directly to the sssTwitter website, which will allow you to download the video.</li><li>You will encounter several Download links. By clicking on them, you will see multiple video quality options. Right-click on the video link of your favored quality and select Save As.</li><li>Give your video a name and choose the location, and press Save to start the download.</li><li>Once the video is downloaded, the next step is posting it to Facebook.</li><li>Open your Facebook app or log on to Facebook from the Web.</li><li>Go to the Newsfeed screen, and on the top, you will find the Create a new Post Text Box.</li><li>Click on add a video to add the video from your PC. Locate the file and wait for it to upload.</li><li>Add an appropriate caption to match the video and click on Post.</li></ul><p>And you have now successfully posted a video from Twitter to Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-Post-Tweets-on-Facebook"><a href="#How-to-Post-Tweets-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How to Post Tweets on Facebook"></a>How to Post Tweets on Facebook</h2><p>Guide every step with good images.</p><p>If you are running a business or an e-commerce store, then posting the same content across various social media platforms can be very important. You can notify your customers about the latest deals, discounts, sales, and products.</p><p>If you are just an individual, then you may simply want to share your thoughts with all your followers on both Facebook and Twitter. But, while this is a great marketing strategy, it can be quite an ordeal typing the same messages or posting the same content separately on each platform.</p><p>In that case, you may simply follow the steps below to connect your social media accounts. You can connect your Facebook profile with Twitter, and as soon as you post a Tweet or retweet something, it will automatically be posted on Twitter too.</p><p>Here is how you can directly post your tweets on Facebook:</p><ul><li>Start by launching your browser on your PC.</li><li>Open Twitter and log into your account by typing in your credentials.</li><li>Now, Click on the little gear sign on the right of the screen to open settings.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-twitter-videos-on-facebook-1.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>From the drop-down menu, select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-twitter-videos-on-facebook-2.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>From the settings screen, select Profile from the tabs on the left.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-twitter-videos-on-facebook-3.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Once opened, scroll downwards until you see Facebook.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-twitter-videos-on-facebook-4.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Click on the<strong>Connect to Facebook</strong></li><li>Now a new window will open Facebook.

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga.

BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2.

The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season.

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite-3"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite-3" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad-3"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man-3"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man-3" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels.

He happens to have tweeted one of the most viewed Twitter videos in 2022.</p><p>He now works as the CEO of Tesla and the CEO and chief designer of SpaceX.

It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.</p><p>And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9’s first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.</p><p>Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-3.png"                      alt="A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><h3 id="4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer"><a href="#4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="4.

Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy. On December 9, 2021, he tweeted a video that only lasts 58 seconds but has received more than 2M views as the world prepares to enter 2022.</p><p>Bill said, I remain hopeful about the prospects for accelerated innovation in the climate field. I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-5.png"                      alt="Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"                ></p><h3 id="6-Neymar’s-Dribbling"><a href="#6-Neymar’s-Dribbling" class="headerlink" title="6.

The Brazilian has 202 club goals in 346 matches and 53 international goals in 83 outings.</p><p>This video is basically about Neymar dribbling in the opposition’s half for fun. Neymar is regarded as one of the best dribblers of this generation of football players. The idea of posting this video was to tell the viewers how good Neymar is when it comes to dribbling and how you just have to sit back and enjoy when he is on the ball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-6.png"                      alt="Neymar&#39;s Dribbling"                ></p><h3 id="7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets"><a href="#7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets" class="headerlink" title="7.

Virat is also considered among the most exemplary leaders in the history of Cricket.

Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-5.png"                      alt="Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"                ></p><h3 id="6-Neymar’s-Dribbling-3"><a href="#6-Neymar’s-Dribbling-3" class="headerlink" title="6.
