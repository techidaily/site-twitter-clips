However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have. This feature allows you to share any Twitter video without retweeting. However, this is quite a nice hack that allows you to reap the same results.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-1"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-1"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-1"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-1" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-1"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-1" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-1"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-1" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-1"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-1"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-2"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-2"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-2" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-2"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-2" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-2"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-2" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-2"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-2" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-2"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-2" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-2"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-2" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-tweet-a-day-your-2023-video-journey-begins-here/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  A Tweet a Day - Your 2023 Video Journey Begins Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-most-engaged-with-tweets/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling The Most Engaged-With Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-essentials-of-creating-a-personalized-twitter-account/"><u>2024 Approved  The Essentials of Creating a Personalized Twitter Account</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-simple-process-of-uploading-videos-to-twitter/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Simple Process of Uploading Videos to Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-twitvidsync-ios-tool-to-seamlessly-save-twitter-vids/"><u>[Updated] TwitVidsync  IOS Tool to Seamlessly Save Twitter Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-twitters-top-10-viral-tiktoks-uncovered/"><u>2024 Approved  Twitter's Top 10 Viral TikToks Uncovered</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-cross-platform-communication-twitch-and-whatsapp-synergy/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Cross-Platform Communication  Twitch & WhatsApp Synergy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unveiling-snapchat-video-feeds-from-twitter/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unveiling Snapchat Video Feeds From Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-twitters-hot-takes-the-10-craziest-tweets/"><u>[New] Twitter's Hot Takes  The 10 Craziest Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-mastering-twitter-videos-a-beginners-tutorial/"><u>[New] Mastering Twitter Videos  A Beginner's Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-seamlessly-share-tweets-as-video-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How To Seamlessly Share Tweets as Video on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-twitters-viral-spotlight-top-10-tiktoks-of-the-week/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Twitter's Viral Spotlight  Top 10 TikToks of the Week</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-selection-of-apps-to-tame-your-feed-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Selection of Apps to Tame Your Feed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-echoes-in-the-stream-full-year-tweet-video-analysis-for-2024/"><u>[New] Echoes in the Stream - Full Year Tweet Video Analysis for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-tiktok-sensation-round-up-twitters-buzzing-top-ten/"><u>In 2024, TikTok Sensation Round-Up  Twitter's Buzzing Top Ten</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-vivo-t2x-5g-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/"><u>Still Using Pattern Locks with Vivo T2x 5G?

Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-is-Viral-Video"><a href="#What-is-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Viral Video?"></a>What is Viral Video?</h2><p>A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.</p><p>Tweets may become viral for a variety of reasons. They might increase awareness of a problem, create arguments, or even be amusing. But what’s common in them is that they attract the users and the influencers to give their views about them.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips"><a href="#Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips"></a>Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips</h2><p>Viral videos are hard to find on other social sites, but Twitter, an open platform for all users, provides easy access to viral or trendy clips.

The following are the top 10 viral hot clips Twitter:</p><h2 id="1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look"><a href="#1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look" class="headerlink" title="1.

Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3.

According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty" class="headerlink" title="4.

LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious.

It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-1"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-1"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-1"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter.

For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel. Learning what the viral <strong>Twitter video hot</strong> is intriguing for someone who is constantly interested in what is on-trend these days.</p><p><a class="link"

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have. This feature allows you to share any Twitter video without retweeting. However, this is quite a nice hack that allows you to reap the same results. Here is how you can share a Twitter video without retweeting:</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure the Twitter app is installed on your phone.</li><li>Open the Twitter app and locate the video you want to share.</li><li>Once you find the video, open the tweet and tap on the small <strong>share icon</strong>under the Tweet.</li><li>This will show you several options. Tap on <strong>Copy Link to Tweet.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-1.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Now go back to the main page and type a new Tweet.</li><li>Compose your Tweet and then paste the URL that you copied.</li><li>Then you need to edit the URL that you pasted. Remove the parameters at the end that is “?s&#x3D;20”.</li><li>After removing, write in place of it “&#x2F;video&#x2F;1”.</li><li>For example if the URL is “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/" >https://twitter.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><username>&#x2F;status&#x2F;1234567890?s&#x3D;”</li><li>Then replace it with “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890/video/1" >https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890/video/1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-2.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Now click on the <strong>Tweet</strong>button to post your Tweet.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-3.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><p>And that’s it! You can add any video to your tweet with this method. This method is for Android users only. You can also follow the same steps if you are using Chrome or Twitter on the web.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-Retweeting-iPhone"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-Retweeting-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without Retweeting iPhone"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without Retweeting iPhone</h2><p>There are various ways to post a video from Twitter without retweeting it. iPhone gives you the option to do that when you want to share the video. You can post the video as your own and comment on it as well without retweeting anyone else’s video.</p><p>There are two methods to do this. One is by using the Tweet Video option, and the other is by using the Shortcuts app on iPhone. This article shows how you can do that by using both methods.</p><h3 id="1-Sharing-Twitter-Videos-with-the-Tweet-Video-Option"><a href="#1-Sharing-Twitter-Videos-with-the-Tweet-Video-Option" class="headerlink" title="1.

Sharing Twitter Videos with the Tweet Video Option</h3><p>If you are an iPhone user, you can easily post any video from Twitter on your profile without retweeting.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-1"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-1"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-1"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-1" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-1"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-1" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-1"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-1" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-1"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-1"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-3"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-3"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-3"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-3" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-3"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-3" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-3"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-3" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

Eight years later, things seem as if they took the turn for the worse because the number of the platform’s monthly users is shrinking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-monthly-active-users.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In the last quarter of 2017, Twitter had only 330 million users, much less than Facebook that had 2,07 billion users or Instagram that had approximately 700 million users over that same period. Despite being easy to use and a powerful tool for reaching like-minded people or potential customers for your company’s products Twitter is slowly losing the reputation it once had.</p><h2 id="Why-Leave-Twitter"><a href="#Why-Leave-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Why Leave Twitter?"></a>Why Leave Twitter?</h2><p>At the end of the last year, the platform has increased the number of characters that can be used in a post, but this move did almost nothing to restore Twitter’s former glory. Celebrities getting caught up in Twitter wars, fake accounts and ultra-right-wing supporters have all contributed to the current state of affairs on Twitter. Most people simply decide to use another social network that doesn’t have the limitations imposed by a misguided company management and users that lack respect for everyone’s right to free speech.</p><h2 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h2><p>The world’s fascination with Twitter was well-deserved because this social network offered unique features that actually foster public discussions and that can enable marketers to reach more users of the products they are advertising. Ten years ago, Twitter was one of the rare platforms that offered these opportunities, but today there are countless social media networks which provide the same service while making sure that their users are happy.</p><h4 id="1-Tumblr"><a href="#1-Tumblr" class="headerlink" title="1. Tumblr"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tumblr.com/" >Tumblr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Tumblr is only a year younger than Twitter, and on April 8.2018 it hosted as many as 406.9 million blogs. Tumblr apps are available on both Android and iOS-based devices, which makes it available to the almost entire online community. The micro-blogging platform focuses on visual content more than on words, and for that reason, it has become an inexhaustible source of images that can be shared on downloaded.</p><p>The Tumbler’s editorial policy prevents open support for suicide or any form of self-harm, but it doesn’t place any other hard restrictions on the platform’s users. The visual nature of platform makes it a perfect tool for promotion of products and services. Tumblr is much more than a simple platform that lets you create photo and video collections because it provides the tools necessary for the online promotion of brands.</p><h4 id="2-Plurk"><a href="#2-Plurk" class="headerlink" title="2. Plurk"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.plurk.com/portal/" >Plurk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For years, Plurk offered the service that is nearly identical to the ones provided by Twitter, and it increased the number of character you can use in a post to 360 just a few years ago. Nearly 70% of all the traffic on the platform comes from Taiwan, so if you are targeting markets in Western Europe or the United States, Plurk may not be the best social network for you.</p><p>Plurk features a horizontal timeline and it lets you share pictures, videos or URLs for web-based articles. The platform stimulates its users to spend more time engaging with other Plurk members through the concept of Karma, which grants you access to more emoticons. This social network can be accessed from iPhones, Android devices or from PC or Mac computers.</p><h4 id="3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok"><a href="#3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)"></a>3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)</h4><p>If you have never heard of this social network you may be getting a bit old, because most users of Musical.ly are aged between 13 and 18. Even though teenagers use it, the platform provides some interesting and amusing features that foster artistic expression and allow you to share your creative output with millions of people.

Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat-3"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send-3"><a href="#Record-and-Send-3" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll-3"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll-3" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.</p><p>Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link-3"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link</h2><p>People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features. If you wish to share a Twitter video with a link on Snapchat, follow these steps to learn how to do it most efficiently.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter-6"><a href="#Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter-6" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log in to Twitter"></a>Step 1: Log in to Twitter</h2><p>Enter your credentials and log in to your Twitter account if you already have not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-1.jpg"                      alt="Log in to Twitter"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share-3"><a href="#Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find the video and tap share"></a>Step 2: Find the video and tap share</h2><p>Scroll through your Twitter feed until you come across a video you would want to share with your friends. For example, a video that shows a new feature of iOS with which you can unlock an iPhone using Face ID, but it works with a mask on as well! It is an informative video, and you want to share it. Tap the share icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-2.jpg"                      alt="Tap share"                ></p><h2 id="Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu-3"><a href="#Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu"></a>Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu</h2><p>Tapping the share icon will open a dialogue box that will show you a few options for sharing the Twitter video. Select Snapchat from the list; if you do not see Snapchat in that list, go ahead and tap on ‘share via.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-3.jpg"                      alt="Choose app"                ></p><p>This will open a list of all applications you can use to share the video. Then all you have to do is select Snapchat from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-4.jpg"                      alt="Choose Snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Step-4-Select-the-Contact-3"><a href="#Step-4-Select-the-Contact-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Select the Contact"></a>Step 4: Select the Contact</h2><p>Tapping on Snapchat will close Twitter and take you to the Snapchat application with a list of all your contacts. From that list, select the contact you want to share the Twitter video with and press send.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-5.jpg"                      alt="Select the Contact"                ></p><p>Doing this will send the video to the desired person with a link. The person or even you now only have to tap the link, and it will directly open Twitter and take you to the exact tweet of that video.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link-3"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link-3" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link"></a>Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link</h2><p>Now, you have learned all the steps required to share twitter videos using Snapchat with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not use Twitter or if they cannot access the Twitter application? Then what?</p><p>There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else, but the link embedding does not work.</p><p>There is an easy way to overcome this issue if you wish to share Twitter Videos on Snapchat directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on Snapchat without any link. Just follow the steps below, and you will be all set.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter-7"><a href="#Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter-7" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log in to Twitter"></a>Step 1: Log in to Twitter</h2><p>Log in to your Twitter using your credentials.</p><h2 id="Step-2-Find-the-Video-and-Tap-Share-3"><a href="#Step-2-Find-the-Video-and-Tap-Share-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find the Video and Tap Share"></a>Step 2: Find the Video and Tap Share</h2><p>Scroll through your Twitter and locate the video you want to share with your friends on Snapchat.

There are various quality options available that include 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality, and the size of the download file varies with the quality.</p><p>The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter.

But we have got you.</p><p>Now that you know all methods of sharing Twitter Videos on Snapchat, with or without the link, follow the steps mentioned above, and it will save you and your friends from the nuisance caused by inter-platform video sharing.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content.

Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort.

You may have assumed it is simply due to the popularity of the service. And while that is part of the reason, there is more to the story.

Its contrast is set such that the text does not blend in with the background but stands out from it. Hence, it is easily readable and does not create a light effect resulting in the audience skipping your video.</p><h3 id="Tip-no-4-Size-3"><a href="#Tip-no-4-Size-3" class="headerlink" title="Tip no 4: Size"></a>Tip no 4: Size</h3><p>The dimensions of your thumbnail photo should be as such that they are compatible with all screen sizes as different users will watch the video on different devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc., so you should not crop out the thumbnail in any way.</p><h3 id="Tip-no-5-Use-a-face-3"><a href="#Tip-no-5-Use-a-face-3" class="headerlink" title="Tip no 5: Use a face"></a>Tip no 5: Use a face</h3><p>It is a part of the human psyche that they are naturally attracted to human faces more than any other graphic or image of any other object. You can always use a face to catch your audience’s attention, but make sure the face is related to the video and does not misguide anyone regarding the topic and context of your video.</p><h3 id="Tip-no-6-Editing-and-Color-Scheme-3"><a href="#Tip-no-6-Editing-and-Color-Scheme-3" class="headerlink" title="Tip no 6: Editing and Color Scheme"></a>Tip no 6: Editing and Color Scheme</h3><p>Always edit and treat the thumbnail photo beforehand. It should be catchy and compliment the content of the video. Be careful while choosing the color scheme of your photo; you can use a similar color palette as your video, or you can use colors in contrast to the theme of your video. It should not look alien in any way.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>These are all the things you need to know about how to add thumbnails to Twitter videos how to change thumbnails.

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.</p><p>Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link</h2><p>People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features.

Twitter is ranked as the top platform for “coming across videos” easily, but not searching like other media. Are you convinced but not sure on how to do it?

First, you need to log into your Twitter account at twitter.com then upload your photos from your computer. Then, click on the icon to upload videos or pictures to your tweet and choose the file you are interested in from your computer.</p><p>Are you trying to upload a video from your phone to your Twitter account? Both processes are the same. Create a new tweet, and then click the icon to upload a video clip or a photo, and you can choose your desired video from your device. It is also possible to trim your video clip if you are interested in a specific part.</p><h3 id="Twitter-video-upload-requirements"><a href="#Twitter-video-upload-requirements" class="headerlink" title="Twitter video upload requirements"></a>Twitter video upload requirements</h3><p>Ensure that your video quality meets the required resolution and length required by Twitter before uploading it. Therefore, take note of these;</p><ul><li>Videos must not exceed 2minutes 20 seconds</li><li>Formats supported are MOV and MP4 on mobile apps and MP4 audio format on the web.</li><li>The Twitter video file size for Twitter videos is 32 x 32, and the maximum Twitter video size is 1200 x 1900 or1920 x 1200</li><li>Twitter video full file size should be 512 Mb. If you want to upload a bigger file, Twitter will automatically reject it since the full-size Twitter video has passed.</li></ul><h3 id="How-to-record-a-video-on-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-record-a-video-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to record a video on Twitter"></a>How to record a video on Twitter</h3><p>You can create a video directly on Twitter in two ways, and both features can be found on the Twitter app only—recording a video and going live. You will get an option to perform either of these by clicking the icon on the app above the tweet interface, as shown in the screenshot below.</p><p>You can create a video directly on Twitter in two ways, and both features can be found on the Twitter app only—recording a video and going live. You will get an option to perform either of these by clicking the icon on the app above the tweet interface, as shown in the screenshot below.</p><p>“Camera” enables you to capture your moments directly and create a video for Twitter, and “Live” will allow you to share with the world whatever you are doing right at the moment by going live.</p><p>While using the “Camera” function, it is possible to hold down to drag and drop and record multiple clips to trim and rearrange them.</p><p>Another feature is the “Live” function; you will click “Go live” and, when you have completed, click on “End video.” Live videos will be posted automatically as tweets so that your followers can find and watch them even after you’ve completed streaming live. It is also possible to download the live video from the web to your device if you’d like.</p><p>And that’s it! If you are using video on Twitter, what outcomes have you seen? The experience is quite good, but how do you do it right? And if you are looking forward to learning more, Find out from the Twitter guide below.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Twitter-Video-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-Twitter-Video-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Twitter Video Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 Twitter Video Aspect Ratio</h2><p>It is explained as the ratio between the height and the width of the video. It decides how long your video will be. As you would have speculated, the aspect ratio can also be used regarding pictures; however, since we’re discussing the video in this article, we won’t deviate to incorporating the aspect ratio for the image.</p><p>● The aspect ratio is written as x:y.</p><p>The 1st number of the aspect ratio refers to the width, while the 2nd number of the aspect ratio refers to the height of the video.</p><p>The videos on Twitter have become the most used content in recent years. The best aspect ratio that should be used in Twitter for videos is 1:2.39 and 2.39:1. You have to make sure that you should go for a higher aspect ratio for videos. Opting higher aspect ratio makes your videos take up more space the engagement of the videos depends upon the visibility of the videos. The higher the visibility, the higher will be the engagement.</p><p>Twitter recommends two aspect ratios for twitter videos.</p><p>● For landscape or portrait, it recommends 16:9.</p><p>For square, it recommends 1:1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-5.jpg"                      alt="twitter video aspect ratio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Making-Videos-for-Twitter-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform"></a>Part 3 Tips for Making Videos for Twitter Platform</h2><h3 id="1-Keep-it-short-and-simple"><a href="#1-Keep-it-short-and-simple" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep it short and simple"></a>1. Keep it short and simple</h3><p>Currently, the world is moving fast; therefore, humans can get distracted instantly, grabbing their attention is easy. But if you want to get the real deal, you’ll need to make the initial part of your video attractive enough for them to wait and watch the other part of the video.</p><p>The first 3 seconds of your video should always carry the main message you intended to share. Also, try as much as possible to make videos in less than 15 seconds to maximize branding impact.</p><p>Employ the same strategy for your tweet copy and try to keep it concise and crisp and stay below 100 characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-6.JPG"                      alt=" twitter video file size"                ></p><h3 id="2-Include-Product-and-People"><a href="#2-Include-Product-and-People" class="headerlink" title="2. Include Product and People"></a>2. Include Product and People</h3><p>Twitter recommends opening up ads while the product is on focus. This has led to a 34% increase in click intent and a 24% increase in positive interest. Twitter also says that having products with human touch or any association with them resulted in an overall response increase by 40 %.</p><p>So you should ensure that your video has a positive human engagement and desire for the product in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-4.jpg"                      alt="maximum twitter video size"                ></p><h3 id="3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach"><a href="#3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach"></a>3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach</h3><p>Hashtags are very common on Twitter, and you will rarely find videos that do not have hashtags. This feature is very helpful because it helps you classify your videos, making them quick to access.</p><p>Many hashtags might be used on a post, but when it comes to Twitter, less is more. So try to stick to 1-2 important hashtags in your Twitter copy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-3.jpg"                      alt="use trending hashtags for twitter"                ></p><h3 id="4-Flash-that-Logo"><a href="#4-Flash-that-Logo" class="headerlink" title="4. Flash that Logo"></a>4. Flash that Logo</h3><p>Twitter recommends that brands place their logos within their video frame and just immediately at the start of the video to drive brand association from the beginning. When logos are placed evidently, the brand recall will increase by 30%.</p><p>You can also put your logo in the upper right or left-hand corner of your video to increase the chances of the brand recall but make sure it is in a more catchy position.</p><h3 id="5-Include-Captions"><a href="#5-Include-Captions" class="headerlink" title="5. Include Captions"></a>5. Include Captions</h3><p>93% of videos on Twitter are viewed through mobile phones; therefore, it’s important to have a video accompanied by sound. This is because many people use Twitter and other social media when they are on the go, and in some cases, they might not access sound.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to use captions and other forms of text to give your video more context so that the viewers can better understand the context.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-1.jpg"                      alt="add captions in twitter video"                ></p><h3 id="6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool"><a href="#6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool" class="headerlink" title="6.

This tool has made it possible to throw in overlays, make elements and come up with animations, insert texts and audios. It’s a one stop solution for advanced video editing to make them look professional.

Engage More Than You Broadcast"></a>7. Engage More Than You Broadcast</h3><p>Brands have forgotten that Twitter is a social network but not a marketing tool in some cases. As a result, Twitter feeds are full of brands and marketers strictly uploading links to their websites for marketing purposes.</p><p>However, some top brands do not allow broadcasting messages on their sites. But if you aim to develop your audience or use Twitter for roles other than brand messaging, you have to engage.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>There are approximately 330 million active users on Twitter each month; with such a big number, your organic post might easily get lost in the crowd. So, selling video ads as an investment should consider getting your brand to the next level. On the other hand, ensure that you follow all the required video specifications for each Twitter video. This is because the last thing you want is an attractive video that cannot be posted. After all, it has the wrong aspect ratio for Twitter video or wrong Twitter video file size. In this case, you need Filmora to resize your videos easily.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Twitter videos have been booming over the past years.

The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.</p><p>As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.</p><p>And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9’s first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.</p><p>Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago.

This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1468664794567700483">**<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></a></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself?
