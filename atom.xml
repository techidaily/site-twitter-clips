The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Every month, Amazon Prime Video, the well-known streaming service, releases new series, movies, and documentaries that many people share across <strong>prime video Twitter</strong> with viewing.

All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-transforming-video-content-on-tiktok-with-oversized-characters/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Transforming Video Content on TikTok with Oversized Characters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-quick-guide-to-capturing-and-storing-twitter-animated-content/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Quick Guide to Capturing and Storing Twitter Animated Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-videosnapper-quickly-download-twitter-content-on-iphone/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved VideoSnapper Quickly Download Twitter Content on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-social-snapshot-examining-twitters-hottest-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Social Snapshot Examining Twitter's Hottest Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-fast-forward-to-forgotten-reddit-threads/"><u>2024 Approved Fast Forward to Forgotten Reddit Threads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-picks-top-tweets-for-must-see-original-series/"><u>2024 Approved Prime Picks Top Tweets for Must-See Original Series</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/connecting-your-apple-homepod-speaker-system-directly-to-your-television-display/"><u>Connecting Your Apple HomePod Speaker System Directly to Your Television Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/experience-the-power-of-oversized-capacity-terramasters-impressive-128tb-raid-enclosure-explained/"><u>Experience the Power of Oversized Capacity: TerraMaster's Impressive 128TB RAID Enclosure Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/how-can-i-use-twitter-archive/"><u>How Can I Use Twitter Archive?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/pioneering-pedagogy-through-film-in-the-classroom/"><u>Pioneering Pedagogy Through Film in the Classroom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-honor-v-purse-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Honor V Purse Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/transform-mov-files-into-gifs-instantly-free-online-services-provided-by-movavi/"><u>Transform MOV Files Into GIFs Instantly: FREE Online Services Provided by Movavi</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Twesocial reviews would be fascinating to read in this respect. Since it was released to the public, everybody has gone wild for it. It did, however, happen gradually.</p><p>Twitter was founded in 2006, and by 2012, over 100 million users were sending around 340 million tweets every day. Twitter had the most following celebrities back in the day, with some net earnings of $1.13 billion.</p><p>You can also post media (pictures and videos) on Twitter without difficulty. Along with the tweets, videos and pictures also go viral with each passing day. Since several videos are posted every day, it’s hard to guess which one is viral these days.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what makes a viral <strong>Twitter video hot</strong>? Twitter’s hype has been boosted every day from its inception for various reasons. One of the numerous things we could question about Twitter is what are the most popular viral Twitter videos. To help you solve that question, we’ve compiled a list of the Top 10 Hot and Viral Videos on Twitter in this article. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-is-Viral-Video"><a href="#What-is-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Viral Video?"></a>What is Viral Video?</h2><p>A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.</p><p>Tweets may become viral for a variety of reasons. They might increase awareness of a problem, create arguments, or even be amusing. But what’s common in them is that they attract the users and the influencers to give their views about them.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips"><a href="#Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips"></a>Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips</h2><p>Viral videos are hard to find on other social sites, but Twitter, an open platform for all users, provides easy access to viral or trendy clips. This quality of Twitter makes it stand out from other social platforms. It helps the user find trendy fashion, sports, cooking, Hollywood, etc., with mere clicks. The following are the top 10 viral hot clips Twitter:</p><h2 id="1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look"><a href="#1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look" class="headerlink" title="1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look"></a>1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look</h2><p>This video reads, “me after seeing Billie’s pictures: #BillieEilish #BillieEilishHotWhile,” which refers to all of us. Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel" class="headerlink" title="2. Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"></a>2. <strong>Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel</strong></h3><p>This video has the caption “Lil Nas X representing the fallen angel Satan.” It was posted on May 27, 2021. However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3. Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"></a>3. <strong>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating</strong></h3><p>The title for this video hot on Twitter reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.” This video has 572K views, and it was posted on November 19, 2021.</p><p>It displays Paul Rudd laughing and replying “Not me” to the interviewer’s question, “Look at us, who would have thought?”, clearly demonstrating the fan’s feelings after hearing the news that Pete and Kim Kardashian, days after Kanye and Kim broke up.</p><p>The title for this viral Twitter video reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.”</p><p>Kim Kardashian’s divorce from Kanye West was possibly this year’s most unexpected yet unsurprising occurrence in popular culture history. According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty" class="headerlink" title="4. Children Being Naughty"></a>4. <strong>Children Being Naughty</strong></h3><p>The hot viral Twitter clip has the caption saying, “Even more reasons not to have kids.” It was uploaded on January 24, 2022, by the well-known Twitter account @LADBible. LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious. In this video, children are doing crazy stuff, such as throwing stuff at the TV, breading the father’s nose, breaking glasses, throwing cereal on the couch, punching their father in serious areas, etc. Moreover, the video has around 622K views on Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-4.png"                      alt="Children Being Naughty"                ></p><h3 id="5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues"><a href="#5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues" class="headerlink" title="5. Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues"></a>5. <strong>Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues</strong></h3><p>“Simone Biles has withdrawn from the vault and poles finals,” Justin Lee said in the video. “I believe now is a perfect time to offer Auburn trainer Jeff Graba’s description of Biles’ problems.” Everyone who has ever been a gymnast knows that when the twisties are mentioned, everyone comes to a halt. It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died" class="headerlink" title="6. Mr. Big Died"></a>6. <strong>Mr. Big Died</strong></h3><p>The title for this video’s hot viral Twitter reads, “WTF #AndJustLikeThat Mr. Big is no longer alive. I assumed he was having a stroke and wondered why Carrie didn’t call for an ambulance…”.</p><p>This video was posted on December 9, 2021, with around 200K views. In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals" class="headerlink" title="7. Kit Harrington Won’t Eat His Cereals"></a>7. <strong>Kit Harrington Won’t Eat His Cereals</strong></h3><p>This viral Twitter video is titled “In loving remembrance of the “Ryan Gosling won’t eat his cereal” vines.” This video was posted on May 26, 2019, from an account named Eugene Buenaventura, and it has around 1.4M Twitter views to date. In this video, Kit Harrington, known for playing John Snow in the popular TV series Game of Thrones, is offered something to eat that he is not eating.</p><p>Following a succession of six-second footage of A-list actor Ryan Gosling being fed a spoonful of breakfast cereal, this clip took its artistic expression as a famous culture treasure on Vine. The video’s caption assured that it swiftly became viral, mirroring the internet trajectory of a significant breakthrough news item.</p><p>The popularity of the Gosling viral demonstrates the importance of strategically seeding your material with the key influencers and how, in some situations, a small number of people may go worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-7.png"                      alt="Video about Kit Harrington Won&#39;t Eat His Cereals"                ></p><h3 id="8-Dove-Brand-Campaign"><a href="#8-Dove-Brand-Campaign" class="headerlink" title="8. Dove Brand Campaign"></a>8. <strong>Dove Brand Campaign</strong></h3><p>The tagline for this video reads, “Dove’s inaugural purpose-driven marketing puts an end to armpit worry. More on the stereotype-busting spot can be seen on @CampaignLiveUS “. It was posted on November 09, 2019, and has around 4K views to the date.</p><p>The film for Dove’s Real Beauty Sketches #WeAreBeautiful ad traveled unlike any other, thanks to a long tail of connection and strong audience reaction.</p><p>This video has shown less fatigue than the others and fewer influencer-induced spikes. Instead, the dialogue took place in clusters of towns scattered over the world, demonstrating the importance of local interaction and highlighting the practical usage of a digital outreach campaign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-8.png"                      alt="Video about Dove Brand Campaign"                ></p><h3 id="9-Cats-Defying-Laws-of-Physics"><a href="#9-Cats-Defying-Laws-of-Physics" class="headerlink" title="9. Cats Defying Laws of Physics"></a>9. <strong>Cats Defying Laws of Physics</strong></h3><p>This hot video on Twitter has the caption, “Cats defying all laws of physics.” On January 24, 2022, it was posted by a famous Twitter account named <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/ladbible/status/1485553202607108096" >@LADBible <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. LADBible has been famous for posting trendy twitter videos to entertain its followers for a long time. Moreover, this Twitter account has many followers (around 2.9M), including some celebrities.</p><p>Although the caption of the video seems a bit cheesy to you at first, you would be amazed and wonder how those cats are doing that stuff when you see the video. In the video, cats are going under the locked door, running on vertical walls, walking under the bed upside down, jumping up to the room’s roof, coming out of a thing cage, etc., which is not exactly typical for a cat do. Furthermore, this video has 270K views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-9.png"                      alt="Cats Defying Laws of Physics"                ></p><h3 id="10-Man-Eating-His-Phone"><a href="#10-Man-Eating-His-Phone" class="headerlink" title="10. Man Eating His Phone"></a>10. <strong>Man Eating His Phone</strong></h3><p>This hot viral clip on Twitter has the title, “Are you eating that?”. It is yet another video posted from the LADBible, a famous page on Twitter that pots trendy and viral videos to entertain its followers and let them have a good time on Twitter. This video was posted on January 24, 2021, with around 688K views.</p><p>After reading the caption, you won’t get the idea of what it is about, so we recommend watching it. However, if you’re too lazy for that, keep reading. It is a 24-second clip featuring a sleeping guy who has a pizza slice in one hand and his phone in the other. After he wakes up, he starts eating his phone instead of the pizza, which looks funny and a bit embarrassing for the man, who just got captured while doing that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-10.png"                      alt="Viral video of a Man Eating His Phone"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to Go Viral on Twitter"></a>How to Go Viral on Twitter</h2><p>With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it’s quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results.

(Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-1"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-1" class="headerlink" title="7.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-1"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1.

The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material.

To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-2"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-2"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-2"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-2"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter.

It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty-3"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious. In this video, children are doing crazy stuff, such as throwing stuff at the TV, breading the father’s nose, breaking glasses, throwing cereal on the couch, punching their father in serious areas, etc. Moreover, the video has around 622K views on Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-4.png"                      alt="Children Being Naughty"                ></p><h3 id="5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues-3"><a href="#5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died-3"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

I assumed he was having a stroke and wondered why Carrie didn’t call for an ambulance…”.</p><p>This video was posted on December 9, 2021, with around 200K views. In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

In this video, Kit Harrington, known for playing John Snow in the popular TV series Game of Thrones, is offered something to eat that he is not eating.</p><p>Following a succession of six-second footage of A-list actor Ryan Gosling being fed a spoonful of breakfast cereal, this clip took its artistic expression as a famous culture treasure on Vine. The video’s caption assured that it swiftly became viral, mirroring the internet trajectory of a significant breakthrough news item.</p><p>The popularity of the Gosling viral demonstrates the importance of strategically seeding your material with the key influencers and how, in some situations, a small number of people may go worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-7.png"                      alt="Video about Kit Harrington Won&#39;t Eat His Cereals"                ></p><h3 id="8-Dove-Brand-Campaign-3"><a href="#8-Dove-Brand-Campaign-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

Instead, the dialogue took place in clusters of towns scattered over the world, demonstrating the importance of local interaction and highlighting the practical usage of a digital outreach campaign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-8.png"                      alt="Video about Dove Brand Campaign"                ></p><h3 id="9-Cats-Defying-Laws-of-Physics-3"><a href="#9-Cats-Defying-Laws-of-Physics-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Moreover, this Twitter account has many followers (around 2.9M), including some celebrities.</p><p>Although the caption of the video seems a bit cheesy to you at first, you would be amazed and wonder how those cats are doing that stuff when you see the video. In the video, cats are going under the locked door, running on vertical walls, walking under the bed upside down, jumping up to the room’s roof, coming out of a thing cage, etc., which is not exactly typical for a cat do. Furthermore, this video has 270K views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-9.png"                      alt="Cats Defying Laws of Physics"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Man-Eating-His-Phone-3"><a href="#10-Man-Eating-His-Phone-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

It is yet another video posted from the LADBible, a famous page on Twitter that pots trendy and viral videos to entertain its followers and let them have a good time on Twitter. This video was posted on January 24, 2021, with around 688K views.</p><p>After reading the caption, you won’t get the idea of what it is about, so we recommend watching it. However, if you’re too lazy for that, keep reading. It is a 24-second clip featuring a sleeping guy who has a pizza slice in one hand and his phone in the other. After he wakes up, he starts eating his phone instead of the pizza, which looks funny and a bit embarrassing for the man, who just got captured while doing that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-10.png"                      alt="Viral video of a Man Eating His Phone"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Go Viral on Twitter"></a>How to Go Viral on Twitter</h2><p>With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it’s quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-3"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-3"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel. Learning what the viral <strong>Twitter video hot</strong> is intriguing for someone who is constantly interested in what is on-trend these days.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-bridging-twitters-visual-content-to-instagram-presence-for-2024/"><u>[New] Bridging Twitter's Visual Content to Instagram Presence for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-choice-top-5-pro-fish-action-cameras/"><u>[New] Ultimate Choice Top 5 Pro-Fish Action Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-4-top-ranked-ways-to-grab-your-chromebook-screen-shot/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved 4 Top-Ranked Ways To Grab Your Chromebook Screen Shot</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-amplify-your-profile-pull-clever-hacks-that-work-on-tinder/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Amplify Your Profile Pull Clever Hacks That Work on Tinder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-whatsapp-transfers-broadcasting-twitter-videos-with-ease/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, WhatsApp Transfers Broadcasting Twitter Videos with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-new-user-registration-on-twitter/"><u>[Updated] Navigating New User Registration on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-twitters-visuals-on-the-social-media-giant-fb-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Twitters' Visuals on the Social Media Giant FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/11-ways-to-fix-it-when-my-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-4g-wont-charge-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>11 Ways to Fix it When My Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G Wont Charge | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/a-seamless-transition-sharing-tiktok-videos-with-twitter/"><u>A Seamless Transition Sharing TikTok Videos with Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-update-or-downgrade-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-without-itunes-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Update or Downgrade Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Without iTunes? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/next-gen-amd-unleashed-the-zen-5-mobile-chip-that-packs-desktop-power-at-just-115w-spotted-in-leaked-photos-of-the-mighty-ryzen-strix-halo-with-a-whopping-179/"><u>Next-Gen AMD Unleashed: The Zen 5 Mobile Chip That Packs Desktop Power at Just 115W - Spotted in Leaked Photos of the Mighty Ryzen Strix Halo with a Whopping 16 Cores & RDNA Graphics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/stuck-at-android-system-recovery-of-motorola-defy-2-fix-it-easily-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Stuck at Android System Recovery Of Motorola Defy 2 ?

Twesocial reviews would be fascinating to read in this respect. Since it was released to the public, everybody has gone wild for it. It did, however, happen gradually.</p><p>Twitter was founded in 2006, and by 2012, over 100 million users were sending around 340 million tweets every day. Twitter had the most following celebrities back in the day, with some net earnings of $1.13 billion.</p><p>You can also post media (pictures and videos) on Twitter without difficulty. Along with the tweets, videos and pictures also go viral with each passing day. Since several videos are posted every day, it’s hard to guess which one is viral these days.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what makes a viral <strong>Twitter video hot</strong>? Twitter’s hype has been boosted every day from its inception for various reasons. One of the numerous things we could question about Twitter is what are the most popular viral Twitter videos. To help you solve that question, we’ve compiled a list of the Top 10 Hot and Viral Videos on Twitter in this article. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-is-Viral-Video"><a href="#What-is-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Viral Video?"></a>What is Viral Video?</h2><p>A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.</p><p>Tweets may become viral for a variety of reasons. They might increase awareness of a problem, create arguments, or even be amusing. But what’s common in them is that they attract the users and the influencers to give their views about them.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips"><a href="#Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips"></a>Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips</h2><p>Viral videos are hard to find on other social sites, but Twitter, an open platform for all users, provides easy access to viral or trendy clips. This quality of Twitter makes it stand out from other social platforms. It helps the user find trendy fashion, sports, cooking, Hollywood, etc., with mere clicks. The following are the top 10 viral hot clips Twitter:</p><h2 id="1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look"><a href="#1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look" class="headerlink" title="1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look"></a>1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look</h2><p>This video reads, “me after seeing Billie’s pictures: #BillieEilish #BillieEilishHotWhile,” which refers to all of us. Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel" class="headerlink" title="2. Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"></a>2. <strong>Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel</strong></h3><p>This video has the caption “Lil Nas X representing the fallen angel Satan.” It was posted on May 27, 2021. However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144271/7443" target="_top" id="2144271">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144271" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144271/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3. Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"></a>3. <strong>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating</strong></h3><p>The title for this video hot on Twitter reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.” This video has 572K views, and it was posted on November 19, 2021.</p><p>It displays Paul Rudd laughing and replying “Not me” to the interviewer’s question, “Look at us, who would have thought?”, clearly demonstrating the fan’s feelings after hearing the news that Pete and Kim Kardashian, days after Kanye and Kim broke up.</p><p>The title for this viral Twitter video reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.”</p><p>Kim Kardashian’s divorce from Kanye West was possibly this year’s most unexpected yet unsurprising occurrence in popular culture history. According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty" class="headerlink" title="4. Children Being Naughty"></a>4. <strong>Children Being Naughty</strong></h3><p>The hot viral Twitter clip has the caption saying, “Even more reasons not to have kids.” It was uploaded on January 24, 2022, by the well-known Twitter account @LADBible. LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious. In this video, children are doing crazy stuff, such as throwing stuff at the TV, breading the father’s nose, breaking glasses, throwing cereal on the couch, punching their father in serious areas, etc. Moreover, the video has around 622K views on Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-4.png"                      alt="Children Being Naughty"                ></p><h3 id="5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues"><a href="#5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues" class="headerlink" title="5. Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues"></a>5. <strong>Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues</strong></h3><p>“Simone Biles has withdrawn from the vault and poles finals,” Justin Lee said in the video. “I believe now is a perfect time to offer Auburn trainer Jeff Graba’s description of Biles’ problems.” Everyone who has ever been a gymnast knows that when the twisties are mentioned, everyone comes to a halt. It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died" class="headerlink" title="6. Mr. Big Died"></a>6. <strong>Mr. Big Died</strong></h3><p>The title for this video’s hot viral Twitter reads, “WTF #AndJustLikeThat Mr. Big is no longer alive. I assumed he was having a stroke and wondered why Carrie didn’t call for an ambulance…”.</p><p>This video was posted on December 9, 2021, with around 200K views.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel.

However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked.

According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson.

In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died-3"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

You can add any video to your tweet with this method. This method is for Android users only. You can also follow the same steps if you are using Chrome or Twitter on the web.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-Retweeting-iPhone"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-Retweeting-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without Retweeting iPhone"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without Retweeting iPhone</h2><p>There are various ways to post a video from Twitter without retweeting it. iPhone gives you the option to do that when you want to share the video.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-3"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-3"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-3"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-3" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-3"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-3" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001446/11832" target="_top" id="1001446">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001446" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001446/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-3"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-3" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Improve-Your-iOS-Device’s-Wireless-Experience-A-Guide-to-8-Wi-Fi-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#Improve-Your-iOS-Device’s-Wireless-Experience-A-Guide-to-8-Wi-Fi-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Improve Your iOS Device’s Wireless Experience: A Guide to 8 Wi-Fi Optimization Tips"></a>Improve Your iOS Device’s Wireless Experience: A Guide to 8 Wi-Fi Optimization Tips</h2><p> A Wi-Fi connection is an essential function of any iPhone—but sometimes a poor signal interferes with surfing the web, using apps, or streaming. In these instances, you should look at ways to improve the Wi-Fi performance on your iPhone.</p><p> Let’s look at fixes that can help you when your iPhone’s Wi-Fi isn’t working properly.</p><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-Router"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-Router" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your Router"></a>1. Restart Your Router</h2><p> This is an often-overlooked step, but sometimes restarting the router is all it takes to fix Wi-Fi problems on your iPhone—especially if other devices are having trouble. Restarting your router brings it back to a fresh state, clearing any temporary problems.</p><p> To restart your router, simply locate its physical power button and toggle it off and back on. Alternately, you can disconnect the power plug. Wait for a minute or so before switching it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/internet-router-in-living-room.png"                      alt="A white internet router sitting on a table"                ></p><p> If you reach the end of this guide and your iPhone’s Wi-Fi still hasn’t improved, the problem likely lies with your router. Follow our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-slow-unstable-wi-fi-connection/" >router speed troubleshooting guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more help; performing a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-router/" >complete router reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may be necessary in extreme cases.</p><h2 id="2-Experiment-With-Router-Placement"><a href="#2-Experiment-With-Router-Placement" class="headerlink" title="2. Experiment With Router Placement"></a>2. Experiment With Router Placement</h2><p> The average Wi-Fi signal has a range of about 150 feet indoors. A longer distance between your iPhone and the router results in a weaker signal, so <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-wireless-dead-zone-and-how-to-eliminate-it/" >consider moving your router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> closer to where you use your phone the most.</p><p> Wi-Fi signals can also get blocked by barricades, such as walls and floors. Try positioning the router in a place that’s within eyesight, clear from barriers. Having your router up higher helps avoid interference from furniture and similar.</p><p> To check the strength of your connection on an iPhone, look at the cone-shaped stripes at the top-left corner, which indicates Wi-Fi strength. Three bars mean the signal is strong, two bars are moderate, and one bar means it’s weak.</p><p> If you live around a lot of people, network congestion could also be an issue. Follow our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/when-defaults-are-bad-how-to-pick-a-unique-wireless-channel-for-your-router/" >changing the channel on your router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to pick something that’s less congested.</p><h2 id="3-Remove-or-Change-Your-iPhone-Case"><a href="#3-Remove-or-Change-Your-iPhone-Case" class="headerlink" title="3. Remove or Change Your iPhone Case"></a>3. Remove or Change Your iPhone Case</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/felipe-santana-qeU6Aw-T7ak-unsplash.jpg"                      alt="an iPhone in a leather case"                ></p><p> Felipe Santana&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://unsplash.com/photos/qeU6Aw-T7ak" >Unsplash <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Most of the materials used in the production of phone cases don’t block or interfere with Wi-Fi signals. However, some can—these are usually metal cases. Metal disrupts the transmission from the antenna, which is located somewhere near the top of your iPhone, depending on the model.</p><p> If your phone case is metal-plated, swap it out for a silicone, plastic, or leather one instead. You should also avoid using metal rings or PopSockets that stick to the back of the phone.</p><h2 id="4-Cut-Down-on-Network-Heavy-Activity"><a href="#4-Cut-Down-on-Network-Heavy-Activity" class="headerlink" title="4. Cut Down on Network-Heavy Activity"></a>4. Cut Down on Network-Heavy Activity</h2><p> Downloads, streaming, and certain apps can hog your available bandwidth. You should <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-out-whos-eating-your-bandwidth-with-these-tips/" >check what’s using your bandwidth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to pinpoint any clear culprits. If this doesn’t turn anything up, you’re going to have to run each app or function individually, one at a time, to see which ones are affecting the Wi-Fi.</p><p> Thankfully, there are also a few ways to cut down the amount of bandwidth your iPhone uses. First, you can check which apps tend to gobble up the most bandwidth by viewing their data usage on your iPhone. Depending on when you last reset the statistics, however, this might not be very accurate.</p><p>To check data usage on your iPhone:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings &gt; Mobile Data</strong> .</li><li>Scroll through the list of apps in the current period and view their data usage right below the names.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/settings-mobile-data-iphone.png"                      alt="data usage information on iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528693/16446" target="_top" id="1528693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528693/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/settings-mobile-data-iphone-1.png"                      alt="data usage information on iPhone"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Next, you can turn off automatic app updates to reduce bandwidth usage in the background:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings &gt; App Store</strong> .</li><li>Turn off<strong>App Updates</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iphone-settings-auto-downloads-off.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Settings - Auto Downloads Turned Off"                ></p><p>With this disabled, you’ll need to manually update apps instead:</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>App Store</strong> app.</li><li>Select<strong>Apps</strong> at the bottom.</li><li>Tap your avatar at the top-right.</li><li>Choose<strong>Update</strong> next to each app under<strong>Available Updates</strong> .</li></ol><p> VPNs require additional bandwidth, so it might be worth turning that off at home if you use one.</p><p> Since streaming can put a lot of strain on your network, opt for downloading media (at non-peak times) over streaming wherever possible, especially media that you repeatedly consumed, such as music. This will require a bit of storage space, but reduces strain on your network in the long run.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977004">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977004">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977004%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977004/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Keep-iOS-Updated"><a href="#5-Keep-iOS-Updated" class="headerlink" title="5.

DNS configuration runs in the background when your iPhone is connected to the internet. The default option depends on your service provider, but you can change it to something else like Google or Cloudflare.</p><p> Changing the DNS can help improve website loading times, circumvent some tracking from your ISP, and potentially increase your safety online.</p><p>To change the DNS server on your iPhone:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> and select<strong>Wi-Fi</strong> .</li><li>Tap the encircled<strong>i</strong> next to your network.</li><li>Scroll down and tap<strong>Configure DNS</strong> .</li><li>Change to<strong>Manual</strong> , then tap<strong>Add Server</strong> .</li><li>Type in the DNS server address(es) you wish to use.

Videos are chosen by a significant majority of people on all social media platforms. But why is this the case?</p><p>Consumers favor videos because they are simple to consume, grasp, and comprehend. In contrast, video producers prefer videos because they know that their content is available to everyone with an internet connection.</p><p>Twitter also keeps up with the times. In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a ‘renowned’ Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.</p><p>To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 <strong>Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</strong>. Let’s dive in.</p><h2 id="What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’"><a href="#What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’" class="headerlink" title="What is ‘Most Viewed?’"></a>What is ‘Most Viewed?’</h2><p>Even though this is hardly rocket science for many, some people continue to conflate the terms’ most watched’ and ‘viral.’ So, what is it that distinguishes the worlds of the two? It’s as easy as the number of views!</p><p>When a video is deemed the ‘most viewed,’ it means that it is currently leading the pack in terms of the number of people who have seen it compared to all other videos on the platform.</p><h2 id="10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter"></a>10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</h2><h3 id="1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz"><a href="#1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz" class="headerlink" title="1. Messi’s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz"></a>1. <strong>Messi’s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz</strong></h3><p>This is the most viewed twitter video of 2022. This video’s caption says, “Lionel still needs to explain how he did this.” This video was posted on January 25, 2022, with around 4.7M views in just two days. This video features Filipe Luiz of Atletico de Madrid getting nutmegged by Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona. Nutmeg is the term used when a ball goes through the legs of the player. It is considered one of the most humiliating things in football for an opponent player.</p><p>Lionel Messi, an Argentinian International, is regarded as one of the best players the footballing world has ever seen. He is a seven times Ballon D’or and a six times FIFA THE BEST award winner. Messi was an integral part of FC Barcelona’s glory period.</p><p>Now, getting back to the video, in the video, Messi is seen nutmegging the Atletico de Madrid’s left-back by the body faint, which was never seen before in football history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-1.png"                      alt="Messi&#39;s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz"                ></p><h3 id="2-A-Metaverse-Prison-Yard-Virtual-Video-By-Elon-Musk"><a href="#2-A-Metaverse-Prison-Yard-Virtual-Video-By-Elon-Musk" class="headerlink" title="2. **A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"></a>2. **<strong>A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk</strong></h3><p>Well, Elon Musk needs no introduction. Still, for those who don’t know the man, Elon Musk is a flamboyant entrepreneur best known as the co-founder of PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA) and the creator of SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, among other ventures. He happens to have tweeted one of the most viewed Twitter videos in 2022.</p><p>He now works as the CEO of Tesla and the CEO and chief designer of SpaceX. He is expected to have a total net worth of $151 billion by 2022. Only Jeff Bezos comes close to him in terms of wealth as the world’s wealthiest person. The rest, you can figure out…</p><p>As for the video, which has gathered a total of 4.6M on Twitter, it says: “me fighting in the metaverse prison yard where I’m doing time for screenshotting nfts.”</p><p>NFTs and Metaverse, we are stepping into a virtual world, aren’t we?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-2.png"                      alt="Video of A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><h3 id="3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX"><a href="#3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX" class="headerlink" title="3. **Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX"></a>3. **<strong>Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX</strong></h3><p>SpaceX’s Falcon 9 medium-lift launch system is a partly reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift spacecraft developed and constructed in the United States. The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.</p><p>As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.</p><p>And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9’s first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.</p><p>Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-3.png"                      alt="A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><h3 id="4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer"><a href="#4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="4. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"></a>4. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer</h3><p>The caption of this twitter video reads, “this season on #EUPHORIA…”. This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy. On December 9, 2021, he tweeted a video that only lasts 58 seconds but has received more than 2M views as the world prepares to enter 2022.</p><p>Bill said, I remain hopeful about the prospects for accelerated innovation in the climate field. I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-5.png"                      alt="Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"                ></p><h3 id="6-Neymar’s-Dribbling"><a href="#6-Neymar’s-Dribbling" class="headerlink" title="6. Neymar’s Dribbling"></a>6. <strong>Neymar’s Dribbling</strong></h3><p>The title of this Twitter video is “Just Neymar.” It is posted from the official Twitter account of the UEFA Champions League, which is considered the biggest club football tournament in Europe. The video was posted on January 25, 2022, and gathered around 1.6M views in just 24 hours.</p><p>On February 5, 1992, he was born in Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil, as Neymar. Neymar is widely considered one of the most talented players of his time.</p><p>The flexible attacker is most effective on the left-wing, although he can also play on the right side and as an attacker or second striker. The Brazilian has 202 club goals in 346 matches and 53 international goals in 83 outings.</p><p>This video is basically about Neymar dribbling in the opposition’s half for fun. Neymar is regarded as one of the best dribblers of this generation of football players. The idea of posting this video was to tell the viewers how good Neymar is when it comes to dribbling and how you just have to sit back and enjoy when he is on the ball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-6.png"                      alt="Neymar&#39;s Dribbling"                ></p><h3 id="7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets"><a href="#7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets" class="headerlink" title="7.

Virat Kohli is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and arguably the greatest. He is undoubtedly the best batsman of this cricketing generation.</p><p>Virat has 71 international tons under his belt, only second to the great Sachin Tendulkar. Virat is also considered among the most exemplary leaders in the history of Cricket. He has hundreds of records in his feather to date.</p><p>Now talking about the video, the sound when the ball is hitting his bat and how he is timing the ball even in the nets is mesmerizing for every cricket fan. It depicts the hard work and dedication he puts in his work. Moreover, he is idolized worldwide for what he has achieved as a batsman and Indian Cricket Team’s captain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-7.png"                      alt="Virat Kohli Practicing in Nets"                ></p><h3 id="8-Ozark-Season-4-Part-1-Trailer"><a href="#8-Ozark-Season-4-Part-1-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="8.

Ozark is an official Netflix TV series that debuted in 2013.</p><p>It is a crime television drama written by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams and created by MRC. A financial planner brings his household from Chicago to the Missouri Ozarks to hide money for a drug lord. The Byrdes and their teenage children, Charlotte and Jonah, are, for the most part, an average family living an ordinary life.</p><p>In the teaser, Marty, and Wendy attempt to negotiate an immunity agreement between Navarro and the FBI. Marty’s conflict with Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) worsens. The last season has 14 episodes, divided into two parts of seven each. Part 1 of Ozark will be available on Netflix on January 21.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-8.png"                      alt="Ozark Season 4 Part 1 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="9-’AVE-IT-’-by-LADbible"><a href="#9-’AVE-IT-’-by-LADbible" class="headerlink" title="9. ****’AVE IT!’ by LADbible**"></a>9. ****’AVE IT!’ by LADbible**</h3><p>Are you ready to see some of the most popular humorous videos on the internet? Although we didn’t intend to include the “fun” genre on our list, we couldn’t help but include this one since we did not want to let this one slip between the cracks.</p><p>We think it’s pretty amusing. That might not be the case for you if you were in the position of the bald man who had his face smacked with the ball kicked by the small youngster standing next to him. While this may sound hazardous or unpleasant, we promise you will have a good chuckle and come away with a different point of view after watching it.</p><p>The video was shared on Twitter today by the LADbible’s account, and it seems to have been seen by as many as 1 million people thus far. That was lightning-fast. And you can pretty much guarantee that this video will continue to gain popularity and get another couple of million views in no time!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-9.png"                      alt="&#39;AVE IT!&#39; by LADbible"                ></p><h3 id="10-Ronaldo-Playing-Football-with-A-Boy-Without-Legs"><a href="#10-Ronaldo-Playing-Football-with-A-Boy-Without-Legs" class="headerlink" title="10.

In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a ‘renowned’ Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.</p><p>To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 <strong>Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</strong>.

Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-1"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-1" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself?

While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material.

In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a ‘renowned’ Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.</p><p>To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 <strong>Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</strong>.

Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt!

To avoid it crashing on startup, you can force the game to launch in windowed mode. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Launch the<strong>Battle.net</strong> launcher and select<strong>Diablo Immortal</strong> from the top pane.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/force-windowed-mode-1.jpg"                                     ></li><li>Click the<strong>gear icon</strong> next to the Play button and click<strong>Game Settings</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/force-windowed-mode-2.jpg"                                     ></li><li>Tick<strong>Additional command line arguments</strong> .

If the crashes persist, move on to the third fix below.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082521/7443" target="_top" id="2082521">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082521" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082521/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Fix-3-–-Rename-the-game-folder"><a href="#Fix-3-–-Rename-the-game-folder" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3 – Rename the game folder"></a>Fix 3 – Rename the game folder</h3><p> It’s hard to explain why but renaming the Diablo Immortal folder is a simple trick that helped many users to run the game properly. To do this, follow the steps:</p><ol><li>Navigate to the<strong>game’s installation folder</strong> . Generally you can find it at C:\Program Files (x86)\Battlenet.</li><li>Rename the<strong>Diablo Immortal folder</strong> to Diablo Immortal1 or whatever you like.</li><li>Open the<strong>Diablo Immortal Launcher</strong> directly from the folder.</li></ol><p> Check if the game works normally now.

If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you may suffer from various performance issues of Diablo Immortal including game crashes, low FPS and stuttering. And you should update the graphics driver for maximum gameplay.</p><p> Major GPU manufacturers frequently release new graphics drivers which will give performance improvements, particularly for newer games. Simply go to their official websites (<a class="link"   href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" >AMD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx" >NVIDIA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), find the driver corresponding with your operating system and download it manually.</p><p> If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers on your own, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct GPU drivers for your Windows version. And it only takes two steps:</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  and install Driver Easy.</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the <strong>Scan Now</strong> button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.</li><li>Click the<strong>Update</strong> button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the<strong>FREE version</strong> ).<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/de-5.7.2-scan-1.jpg"                                     ><br> Or click<strong>Update All</strong> to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Pro version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.

This isn’t to say that you won’t be able to complete the task. All you have to do now is be creative with the tools you do have. When making, modifying, and publishing videos to Twitter, whether on a smartphone or a computer, keep these <strong>best formats for Twitter videos</strong> in mind. They’re important for a pleasant user experience and the success of your profile. If all of the above seems like too much trouble, you can always hire someone to perform the task for you. There are plenty of firms that can make videos that get your brand recognized, in the right file format, and optimized to meet all of Twitter’s video requirements.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Twitter is an internationally renowned online news and social networking platform.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-2"><a href="#In-this-article-2" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-2"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7. Video bitrate limit on Twitter</strong></p><p>Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-2"><a href="#Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-2" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Specifications for Twitter"></a>Best Video Specifications for Twitter</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Best Format Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1280x720, 720x1280, 720x720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 or 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Minimum)</strong></td><td>5000 kbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Maximum)</strong></td><td>128 kbps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With video consumption increasing year after year, Twitter video helps you to remain current and attract an audience that values video content for knowledge.

By keeping an eye out for things like these, you can guarantee <strong>how to post videos on Twitter</strong> in the best possible form for a better watching experience.</p><ul><li>Never exceed a frame of 30 frames per second.

This isn’t to say that you won’t be able to complete the task. All you have to do now is be creative with the tools you do have. When making, modifying, and publishing videos to Twitter, whether on a smartphone or a computer, keep these <strong>best formats for Twitter videos</strong> in mind. They’re important for a pleasant user experience and the success of your profile. If all of the above seems like too much trouble, you can always hire someone to perform the task for you. There are plenty of firms that can make videos that get your brand recognized, in the right file format, and optimized to meet all of Twitter’s video requirements.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Twitter is an internationally renowned online news and social networking platform. Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7. Video bitrate limit on Twitter</strong></p><p>Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Specifications for Twitter"></a>Best Video Specifications for Twitter</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Best Format Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1280x720, 720x1280, 720x720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 or 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Minimum)</strong></td><td>5000 kbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Maximum)</strong></td><td>128 kbps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With video consumption increasing year after year, Twitter video helps you to remain current and attract an audience that values video content for knowledge. Purchase intent rises by 34% when videos are shared on Twitter. In truth, Twitter is about far more than 280 characters: it’s about telling a narrative, your story.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?"></a>Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?</h2><p>Both Twitter In-feed videos and Twitter video advertising have comparable video specs, which is fortunate for you. However, we’ll still go through the Twitter video criteria for each of them, as well as some best practices for increasing interaction. It’s critical to understand the proper Twitter video specifications, such as the maximum size limit, format, and aspect ratios. By keeping an eye out for things like these, you can guarantee <strong>how to post videos on Twitter</strong> in the best possible form for a better watching experience.</p><ul><li>Never exceed a frame of 30 frames per second. Although Twitter can accept files with a frame rate of 40 frames per second, limiting your video to 30 frames per second will ensure cross-channel compatibility.</li></ul><h2 id="1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC-3"><a href="#1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-2"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-2" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-2"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-2" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously.
