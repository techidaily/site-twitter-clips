This simple hack will allow you to manage multiple accounts from the same email address.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977020">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977020.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977020">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977020.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977020%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977020/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-you-log-in-to-more-than-one-Twitter-Account-at-a-time-via-the-web-2"><a href="#Can-you-log-in-to-more-than-one-Twitter-Account-at-a-time-via-the-web-2" class="headerlink" title="Can you log in to more than one Twitter Account at a time via the web?"></a>Can you log in to more than one Twitter Account at a time via the web?</h2><p> Accessing a few different Twitter accounts from the same web browser isn’t an option since you first have to log out from one account in order to be able to log in to another one within the same web browser.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-1"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5.

There are over 500 million tweets shared every day!</p><p>Whether you want to have a funny banter with your followers, follow your favorite celebrity or keep up with the latest global news, Twitter is the best option. You can find a vast pool of content on Twitter, including one-line tweets to threads, pictures, gifs, and videos.</p><p>However, many users often complain about no sound on Twitter videos. If your Twitter videos have no sound, it also leads to a bad user experience.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss the reasons why is there no sound on Twitter videos and the best solution to fix this issue.</p><p>So, let’s begin!</p><h2 id="Why-Is-There-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos"><a href="#Why-Is-There-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Is There No Sound on Twitter Videos?"></a>Why Is There No Sound on Twitter Videos?</h2><p>There are many reasons for no sound on uploaded twitter videos. The issue could be with your device, browser, or the Twitter app itself.</p><p>Here are all the possible reasons why there is no sound on Twitter videos.</p><h3 id="1-Problem-with-the-App"><a href="#1-Problem-with-the-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Problem with the App"></a>1. Problem with the App</h3><p>There could be a problem with Twitter video sound because of an in-app issue. For example, you have an outdated version of the app, or the app cache is full. Things like that can often create issues and hinder the app’s functionality.</p><h3 id="2-Network-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Network-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Network Connectivity"></a>2. Network Connectivity</h3><p>A weak network connection can also be a common cause of no sound or poor video quality. With a weak or faulty connection, you will see a loading symbol on the video&#x2F;audio file that never seems to end – something painstakingly annoying!</p><p>A strong internet connection will avoid Twitter videos’ improper functionality and smoothly load the file’s contents.</p><h3 id="3-Old-Browsers"><a href="#3-Old-Browsers" class="headerlink" title="3. Old Browsers"></a>3. Old Browsers</h3><p>An old browser lags and does not load files properly. Thus, it can be a reason for no audio on the Twitter videos. Either update the browser or switch to a new browser altogether.</p><h3 id="4-The-Twitter-Cache"><a href="#4-The-Twitter-Cache" class="headerlink" title="4. The Twitter Cache"></a>4. The Twitter Cache</h3><p>The browser cookies or cache and Twitter application cache can also cause Twitter video sound problems. When the cache is full, the app or browser will not perform to its optimal potential.</p><h3 id="5-System-Software-Updates"><a href="#5-System-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="5. System Software Updates"></a>5. System Software Updates</h3><p>Your device could also cause no sound on the Twitter video. When you don’t update the operating system software of your PC&#x2F;Phone, it can cause errors in the device and lead to functionality issues. Moreover, the Twitter app might also not be compatible with an outdated system.</p><h3 id="6-Device-Storage"><a href="#6-Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="6. Device Storage"></a>6. Device Storage</h3><p>When the device memory is full, it can lead to formatting issues, causing no sound on Twitter videos.</p><h3 id="7-Video-Format"><a href="#7-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="7. Video Format"></a>7. Video Format</h3><p>An incompatible video format uploaded on Twitter will also have no sound. Sometimes, there is nothing you can do about it if the video format is incorrect. It will show all kinds of errors, including no sound.</p><h2 id="How-to-Fix-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos-on-Chrome"><a href="#How-to-Fix-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos-on-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix No Sound on Twitter Videos on Chrome?"></a>How to Fix No Sound on Twitter Videos on Chrome?</h2><p>Sometimes no sound on Twitter videos could be due to a browser-related issue.

The issue could be with your device, browser, or the Twitter app itself.</p><p>Here are all the possible reasons why there is no sound on Twitter videos.</p><h3 id="1-Problem-with-the-App-3"><a href="#1-Problem-with-the-App-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Problem with the App"></a>1. Problem with the App</h3><p>There could be a problem with Twitter video sound because of an in-app issue. For example, you have an outdated version of the app, or the app cache is full. Things like that can often create issues and hinder the app’s functionality.</p><h3 id="2-Network-Connectivity-3"><a href="#2-Network-Connectivity-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Network Connectivity"></a>2. Network Connectivity</h3><p>A weak network connection can also be a common cause of no sound or poor video quality. With a weak or faulty connection, you will see a loading symbol on the video&#x2F;audio file that never seems to end – something painstakingly annoying!</p><p>A strong internet connection will avoid Twitter videos’ improper functionality and smoothly load the file’s contents.</p><h3 id="3-Old-Browsers-3"><a href="#3-Old-Browsers-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Moreover, the Twitter app might also not be compatible with an outdated system.</p><h3 id="6-Device-Storage-3"><a href="#6-Device-Storage-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Device Storage"></a>6. Device Storage</h3><p>When the device memory is full, it can lead to formatting issues, causing no sound on Twitter videos.</p><h3 id="7-Video-Format-3"><a href="#7-Video-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Video Format"></a>7. Video Format</h3><p>An incompatible video format uploaded on Twitter will also have no sound. Sometimes, there is nothing you can do about it if the video format is incorrect.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe.

So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-2"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-2"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-2" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-2"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-2" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-2"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-2" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-2"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-2" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-2"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-2" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-2"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-2" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-3"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-3"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-3"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-3" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-3"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-3" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-3"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-3" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

With over 2.8 Billion views, Zach King flying on a broom is the most-watched video on TikTok. And for a reason: be it the caption or video, every second of it is enough to awe the user.</p><p>Zach currently has over 66 Million followers on TikTok, and a hefty number of followers came after his enthralling Harry Potter video with the caption: “They rejected my application to Hogwarts, but I still found a way to be a wizard.”</p><p>In the video, Zach is flying on the broom in the first part, whereas the second part reveals the illusion. Zach can be seen with a mirror and a fake leg hanging on it, and he is moving on a skateboard. So, there you go! A little bit of cleverness and the shame of having to reveal your trick is all it takes to make your video the most-watched video on TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/zachking/status/1204490381200506880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1204698987325837313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2019/12/11/incredible-harry-potter-broom-trick/" >Zach King’s Harry Potter Illusion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones"><a href="#2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones" class="headerlink" title="2.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content. The lesson to learn here is although a clip of mere seconds, creators should put effort and time and really feel like shooting a real movie.

Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings" class="headerlink" title="4.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content. The lesson to learn here is although a clip of mere seconds, creators should put effort and time and really feel like shooting a real movie.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-2"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

Millions of people globally are competing to create something new, simple, and creative, something that not only engages the audience but also forces them to rewatch, like, share, and comment on the clip.</p><p>Wann’ know how to create something simple yet trend-worthy on TikTok?

With over 2.8 Billion views, Zach King flying on a broom is the most-watched video on TikTok. And for a reason: be it the caption or video, every second of it is enough to awe the user.</p><p>Zach currently has over 66 Million followers on TikTok, and a hefty number of followers came after his enthralling Harry Potter video with the caption: “They rejected my application to Hogwarts, but I still found a way to be a wizard.”</p><p>In the video, Zach is flying on the broom in the first part, whereas the second part reveals the illusion. Zach can be seen with a mirror and a fake leg hanging on it, and he is moving on a skateboard. So, there you go! A little bit of cleverness and the shame of having to reveal your trick is all it takes to make your video the most-watched video on TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/zachking/status/1204490381200506880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1204698987325837313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2019/12/11/incredible-harry-potter-broom-trick/" >Zach King’s Harry Potter Illusion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones-3"><a href="#2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content. The lesson to learn here is although a clip of mere seconds, creators should put effort and time and really feel like shooting a real movie. And only when you shoot videos with this kind of spirit expect them to go viral.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@totouchanemu/video/6990181852803894533?is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6981905548543346181" >David Allen Dancing with Drones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”-3"><a href="#3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-3"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

Videos are chosen by a significant majority of people on all social media platforms. But why is this the case?</p><p>Consumers favor videos because they are simple to consume, grasp, and comprehend. In contrast, video producers prefer videos because they know that their content is available to everyone with an internet connection.</p><p>Twitter also keeps up with the times. In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a ‘renowned’ Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.</p><p>To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 <strong>Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</strong>. Let’s dive in.</p><h2 id="What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’"><a href="#What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’" class="headerlink" title="What is ‘Most Viewed?’"></a>What is ‘Most Viewed?’</h2><p>Even though this is hardly rocket science for many, some people continue to conflate the terms’ most watched’ and ‘viral.’ So, what is it that distinguishes the worlds of the two? It’s as easy as the number of views!</p><p>When a video is deemed the ‘most viewed,’ it means that it is currently leading the pack in terms of the number of people who have seen it compared to all other videos on the platform.</p><h2 id="10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter"></a>10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</h2><h3 id="1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz"><a href="#1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz" class="headerlink" title="1.

This video’s caption says, “Lionel still needs to explain how he did this.” This video was posted on January 25, 2022, with around 4.7M views in just two days. This video features Filipe Luiz of Atletico de Madrid getting nutmegged by Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona. Nutmeg is the term used when a ball goes through the legs of the player. It is considered one of the most humiliating things in football for an opponent player.</p><p>Lionel Messi, an Argentinian International, is regarded as one of the best players the footballing world has ever seen. He is a seven times Ballon D’or and a six times FIFA THE BEST award winner. Messi was an integral part of FC Barcelona’s glory period.</p><p>Now, getting back to the video, in the video, Messi is seen nutmegging the Atletico de Madrid’s left-back by the body faint, which was never seen before in football history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-1.png"                      alt="Messi&#39;s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz"                ></p><h3 id="2-A-Metaverse-Prison-Yard-Virtual-Video-By-Elon-Musk"><a href="#2-A-Metaverse-Prison-Yard-Virtual-Video-By-Elon-Musk" class="headerlink" title="2. **A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"></a>2. **<strong>A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk</strong></h3><p>Well, Elon Musk needs no introduction. Still, for those who don’t know the man, Elon Musk is a flamboyant entrepreneur best known as the co-founder of PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA) and the creator of SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, among other ventures. He happens to have tweeted one of the most viewed Twitter videos in 2022.</p><p>He now works as the CEO of Tesla and the CEO and chief designer of SpaceX. He is expected to have a total net worth of $151 billion by 2022. Only Jeff Bezos comes close to him in terms of wealth as the world’s wealthiest person. The rest, you can figure out…</p><p>As for the video, which has gathered a total of 4.6M on Twitter, it says: “me fighting in the metaverse prison yard where I’m doing time for screenshotting nfts.”</p><p>NFTs and Metaverse, we are stepping into a virtual world, aren’t we?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-2.png"                      alt="Video of A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943647/22993" target="_top" id="1943647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX"><a href="#3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX" class="headerlink" title="3. **Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX"></a>3. **<strong>Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX</strong></h3><p>SpaceX’s Falcon 9 medium-lift launch system is a partly reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift spacecraft developed and constructed in the United States. The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.</p><p>As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.</p><p>And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9’s first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.</p><p>Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-3.png"                      alt="A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><h3 id="4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer"><a href="#4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="4.

This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy. On December 9, 2021, he tweeted a video that only lasts 58 seconds but has received more than 2M views as the world prepares to enter 2022.</p><p>Bill said, I remain hopeful about the prospects for accelerated innovation in the climate field. I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again.”</p><p>Isn’t it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-5.png"                      alt="Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"                ></p><h3 id="6-Neymar’s-Dribbling"><a href="#6-Neymar’s-Dribbling" class="headerlink" title="6. Neymar’s Dribbling"></a>6. <strong>Neymar’s Dribbling</strong></h3><p>The title of this Twitter video is “Just Neymar.” It is posted from the official Twitter account of the UEFA Champions League, which is considered the biggest club football tournament in Europe. The video was posted on January 25, 2022, and gathered around 1.6M views in just 24 hours.</p><p>On February 5, 1992, he was born in Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil, as Neymar. Neymar is widely considered one of the most talented players of his time.</p><p>The flexible attacker is most effective on the left-wing, although he can also play on the right side and as an attacker or second striker. The Brazilian has 202 club goals in 346 matches and 53 international goals in 83 outings.</p><p>This video is basically about Neymar dribbling in the opposition’s half for fun. Neymar is regarded as one of the best dribblers of this generation of football players. The idea of posting this video was to tell the viewers how good Neymar is when it comes to dribbling and how you just have to sit back and enjoy when he is on the ball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-6.png"                      alt="Neymar&#39;s Dribbling"                ></p><h3 id="7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets"><a href="#7-Virat-Kohli-Practicing-in-Nets" class="headerlink" title="7.

Virat Kohli is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and arguably the greatest. He is undoubtedly the best batsman of this cricketing generation.</p><p>Virat has 71 international tons under his belt, only second to the great Sachin Tendulkar. Virat is also considered among the most exemplary leaders in the history of Cricket. He has hundreds of records in his feather to date.</p><p>Now talking about the video, the sound when the ball is hitting his bat and how he is timing the ball even in the nets is mesmerizing for every cricket fan. It depicts the hard work and dedication he puts in his work. Moreover, he is idolized worldwide for what he has achieved as a batsman and Indian Cricket Team’s captain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-7.png"                      alt="Virat Kohli Practicing in Nets"                ></p><h3 id="8-Ozark-Season-4-Part-1-Trailer"><a href="#8-Ozark-Season-4-Part-1-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="8.

This video was posted on January 10, 2022 and has around 1.2M views to date. Ozark is an official Netflix TV series that debuted in 2013.</p><p>It is a crime television drama written by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams and created by MRC. A financial planner brings his household from Chicago to the Missouri Ozarks to hide money for a drug lord. The Byrdes and their teenage children, Charlotte and Jonah, are, for the most part, an average family living an ordinary life.</p><p>In the teaser, Marty, and Wendy attempt to negotiate an immunity agreement between Navarro and the FBI. Marty’s conflict with Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) worsens. The last season has 14 episodes, divided into two parts of seven each. Part 1 of Ozark will be available on Netflix on January 21.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-8.png"                      alt="Ozark Season 4 Part 1 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="9-’AVE-IT-’-by-LADbible"><a href="#9-’AVE-IT-’-by-LADbible" class="headerlink" title="9. ****’AVE IT!’ by LADbible**"></a>9. ****’AVE IT!’ by LADbible**</h3><p>Are you ready to see some of the most popular humorous videos on the internet? Although we didn’t intend to include the “fun” genre on our list, we couldn’t help but include this one since we did not want to let this one slip between the cracks.</p><p>We think it’s pretty amusing. That might not be the case for you if you were in the position of the bald man who had his face smacked with the ball kicked by the small youngster standing next to him.

But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-1"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-1" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material.

While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material.

While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100538/7443" target="_top" id="2100538">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100538" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

After he wakes up, he starts eating his phone instead of the pizza, which looks funny and a bit embarrassing for the man, who just got captured while doing that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-10.png"                      alt="Viral video of a Man Eating His Phone"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to Go Viral on Twitter"></a>How to Go Viral on Twitter</h2><p>With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it’s quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel.

However, if you’re too lazy for that, keep reading. It is a 24-second clip featuring a sleeping guy who has a pizza slice in one hand and his phone in the other. After he wakes up, he starts eating his phone instead of the pizza, which looks funny and a bit embarrassing for the man, who just got captured while doing that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-10.png"                      alt="Viral video of a Man Eating His Phone"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-1"><a href="#How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Go Viral on Twitter"></a>How to Go Viral on Twitter</h2><p>With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it’s quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-1"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-1"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-1"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter.

According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson.

It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died-2"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134243/18498" target="_top" id="2134243">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134243" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134243/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-2"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-2" class="headerlink" title="7.
