As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter.

Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort-3"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort-3" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have. This feature allows you to share any Twitter video without retweeting. However, this is quite a nice hack that allows you to reap the same results. Here is how you can share a Twitter video without retweeting:</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure the Twitter app is installed on your phone.</li><li>Open the Twitter app and locate the video you want to share.</li><li>Once you find the video, open the tweet and tap on the small <strong>share icon</strong>under the Tweet.</li><li>This will show you several options.

Remove the parameters at the end that is “?s&#x3D;20”.</li><li>After removing, write in place of it “&#x2F;video&#x2F;1”.</li><li>For example if the URL is “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/" >https://twitter.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><username>&#x2F;status&#x2F;1234567890?s&#x3D;”</li><li>Then replace it with “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890/video/1" >https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890/video/1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-2.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Now click on the <strong>Tweet</strong>button to post your Tweet.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-3.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><p>And that’s it! You can add any video to your tweet with this method. This method is for Android users only. You can also follow the same steps if you are using Chrome or Twitter on the web.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-Retweeting-iPhone"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-Retweeting-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without Retweeting iPhone"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without Retweeting iPhone</h2><p>There are various ways to post a video from Twitter without retweeting it. iPhone gives you the option to do that when you want to share the video. You can post the video as your own and comment on it as well without retweeting anyone else’s video.</p><p>There are two methods to do this. One is by using the Tweet Video option, and the other is by using the Shortcuts app on iPhone. This article shows how you can do that by using both methods.</p><h3 id="1-Sharing-Twitter-Videos-with-the-Tweet-Video-Option"><a href="#1-Sharing-Twitter-Videos-with-the-Tweet-Video-Option" class="headerlink" title="1. Sharing Twitter Videos with the Tweet Video Option"></a>1. Sharing Twitter Videos with the Tweet Video Option</h3><p>If you are an iPhone user, you can easily post any video from Twitter on your profile without retweeting. This method uses the Tweet Video app on iPhone that allows you to seamlessly Tweet videos without retweeting. So, let us dive in:</p><ul><li>Open your Twitter app and log in with your credentials.</li><li>Locate the video you want to share.</li><li>Tap and hold down the play button on the video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-4.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>This will show some options on the screen. Select the <strong>Tweet Video</strong>option from the bottom of the screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-5.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>This will automatically generate the URL for the video for you to Tweet.</li><li>The URL will already be pasted in the Compose Tweet Box. Now, you can add any caption you like to the video and click on <strong>Tweet</strong>to post the video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-6.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><p>The video will now successfully be Tweeted without being retweeted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-7.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Sharing-Twitter-Videos-with-the-Shortcuts-App"><a href="#2-Sharing-Twitter-Videos-with-the-Shortcuts-App" class="headerlink" title="2.

Sharing Twitter Videos with the Shortcuts App</h3><p>A very easy way to Tweet a Twitter video without retweeting is by using the Shortcuts app. The Shortcuts app allows you to run a whole process on your phone by creating a shortcut for it. Here is how you can Tweet a video with the Shortcuts app:</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure you have the Shortcuts app installed on your iPhone. If you don’t have it, you can easily install it from the Apple store.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-8.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Next, open your phone’s browser and open <a class="link"   href="https://www.tvdl.app/" >https://www.tvdl.app/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With TVDL, you can download Twitter videos on your phone by entering their URL.</li><li>You will see the <strong>Get Shortcut</strong>option on your screen. Tap on it.</li><li>This will redirect to the shortcuts app, where you can create a shortcut for the website.</li><li>Add the TVDL link there and in the description, tap on <strong>Add Untrusted Shortcut</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-9.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>If you see an error message, you can go to <strong>Settings</strong>and then turn on the <strong>Allow Untrusted Shortcuts</strong></li><li>Now, open your Twitter app and locate the video you want to Tweet.</li><li>Tap on the small share icon under the Tweet and then tap on <strong>Share Video Via….</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-10.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>From the options, select the TVDL shortcut.</li><li>If this is your first time using this shortcut, you would need to grant access to third-party API, your Twitter account, and the Photos app so you can save videos on your phone.</li><li>You can then select the download quality, and the video will start downloading.</li><li>Once downloaded, it will save in your Photos app.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-11.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>To Tweet, the video, open your Twitter account and go to Create a New Tweet.</li><li>Under the Compose Tweet box, you will find the option to add a video from your gallery.</li><li>For ease of access, the most recent videos in the gallery will appear as top thumbnails, and you will find the video you just downloaded in it.</li><li>You can then trim the length of the video as the max limit for a video is 2 minutes and 20 seconds.</li><li>Once trimmed, you can click on Tweet to post the video along with a lovely caption.</li></ul><p>And that is how you can post a Twitter video without retweeting it from your iPhone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>While retweeting takes a single click, posting the same video on your Twitter profile without Retweeting also takes around the same amount of time.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-3"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-3"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-3"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-3" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-3"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-3" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-3"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-3" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-1"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-1"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-1"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands.

When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter.

Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort-3"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort-3" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-twittableplustumble-posting-videos-easily/"><u>[New] Twittable+Tumble  Posting Videos Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/social-media-synopsis-top-trending-twitvideos-for-2024/"><u>Social Media Synopsis  Top Trending TwitVideos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-hd-chronicles-of-twitters-visual-content/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The HD Chronicles of Twitter's Visual Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-the-secrets-of-a-fresh-twitter-account-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unveiling the Secrets of a Fresh Twitter Account for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-deciphering-the-twitter-archive-a-beginners-tutorial/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Deciphering the Twitter Archive  A Beginner's Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/premium-guide-capturing-and-storing-tweets-jokes-on-pc/"><u>Premium Guide  Capturing and Storing Tweets Jokes on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-cringe-worthy-tweets-the-collection-for-2024/"><u>[New] Cringe-Worthy Tweets  The Collection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-thriving-in-twitter-live-tv-mode/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Thriving in Twitter Live TV Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/unveiling-tiktok-to-twitter-conversion-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling TikTok to Twitter Conversion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-reclaim-lively-sounds-in-muted-video-tweets/"><u>[New] Reclaim Lively Sounds in Muted Video Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-twitters-live-video-landscape-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Navigating Twitter's Live Video Landscape for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-twitters-viral-hits-yearly-top-10-viewer-counts/"><u>[New] In 2024, Twitter's Viral Hits  Yearly Top 10 Viewer Counts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-proficiently-use-twitter-archives/"><u>2024 Approved  How to Proficiently Use Twitter Archives?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-chuckle-champs-twitters-humor-heap-for-2024/"><u>[New] Chuckle-Champs  Twitter’s Humor Heap for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-the-path-from-twitter-video-to-fb-sharing-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Path From Twitter Video to FB Sharing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-whats-buzzing-the-social-sphere-tiktok-and-twitter-hits-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] What's Buzzing the Social Sphere?

Twesocial reviews would be fascinating to read in this respect. Since it was released to the public, everybody has gone wild for it. It did, however, happen gradually.</p><p>Twitter was founded in 2006, and by 2012, over 100 million users were sending around 340 million tweets every day. Twitter had the most following celebrities back in the day, with some net earnings of $1.13 billion.</p><p>You can also post media (pictures and videos) on Twitter without difficulty.

To help you solve that question, we’ve compiled a list of the Top 10 Hot and Viral Videos on Twitter in this article. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-is-Viral-Video"><a href="#What-is-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Viral Video?"></a>What is Viral Video?</h2><p>A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.</p><p>Tweets may become viral for a variety of reasons. They might increase awareness of a problem, create arguments, or even be amusing. But what’s common in them is that they attract the users and the influencers to give their views about them.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips"><a href="#Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips"></a>Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips</h2><p>Viral videos are hard to find on other social sites, but Twitter, an open platform for all users, provides easy access to viral or trendy clips. This quality of Twitter makes it stand out from other social platforms. It helps the user find trendy fashion, sports, cooking, Hollywood, etc., with mere clicks. The following are the top 10 viral hot clips Twitter:</p><h2 id="1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look"><a href="#1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look" class="headerlink" title="1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look"></a>1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look</h2><p>This video reads, “me after seeing Billie’s pictures: #BillieEilish #BillieEilishHotWhile,” which refers to all of us. Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel" class="headerlink" title="2. Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"></a>2. <strong>Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel</strong></h3><p>This video has the caption “Lil Nas X representing the fallen angel Satan.” It was posted on May 27, 2021. However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel.

Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died-3"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

The visual nature of platform makes it a perfect tool for promotion of products and services.

Plurk</h4><p>For years, Plurk offered the service that is nearly identical to the ones provided by Twitter, and it increased the number of character you can use in a post to 360 just a few years ago. Nearly 70% of all the traffic on the platform comes from Taiwan, so if you are targeting markets in Western Europe or the United States, Plurk may not be the best social network for you.</p><p>Plurk features a horizontal timeline and it lets you share pictures, videos or URLs for web-based articles. The platform stimulates its users to spend more time engaging with other Plurk members through the concept of Karma, which grants you access to more emoticons.

Even though teenagers use it, the platform provides some interesting and amusing features that foster artistic expression and allow you to share your creative output with millions of people. Twitter users often share songs and videos posted on Musical.ly, so why not leave Twitter and start sharing your own creative content on this social media network.</p><p>Musical.ly lets you record songs, conversations, and all types of audio-visual content, but in order to access it, you must first install the app on your Android or iPhone device.

Be it as it may, Gab.ai still offers shelter to people who think that hate speech or non-art related public nudity is somehow okay in the public domain. However, you really have to look for unsavory content, and most of the posts on the platform are dedicated to memes, pop culture or art.</p><p>Gab.ai doesn’t support ads, so it isn’t the best choice for companies and independent entrepreneurs who want to advertise their products or reach new markets. However, posts that get a lot of views and comments, do earn money, although the platform doesn’t support conventional online marketing techniques.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram"><a href="#5-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram"></a>5. Instagram</h4><p>People who enjoy sharing a photo on Twitter from time to time should switch to Instagram because the platform provides much more photo editing features. In addition to amazing photo effects you can use on Instagram, you can post videos, which last up to sixty seconds or Stories that also last less than one minute. The platform’s aspect ratio restrictions have been lifted so, you can post square, horizontally and vertically oriented images or videos.</p><p>Even though you can access Instagram from a Mac or PC computer, you have to install the app for iPhones or Android phones in order to be able to post new content on Instagram.

However, posts that get a lot of views and comments, do earn money, although the platform doesn’t support conventional online marketing techniques.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram-3"><a href="#5-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram"></a>5. Instagram</h4><p>People who enjoy sharing a photo on Twitter from time to time should switch to Instagram because the platform provides much more photo editing features. In addition to amazing photo effects you can use on Instagram, you can post videos, which last up to sixty seconds or Stories that also last less than one minute. The platform’s aspect ratio restrictions have been lifted so, you can post square, horizontally and vertically oriented images or videos.</p><p>Even though you can access Instagram from a Mac or PC computer, you have to install the app for iPhones or Android phones in order to be able to post new content on Instagram. The social media platform supports sponsored content as well as ads, which makes it a perfect choice for everyone who wants to develop their business.</p><p>What is your favorite Twitter alternative? Which awesome social networks we failed to mention?

People and pages compete for more likes, followers, comments, etc. The competition is basically to engage a more significant audience, and people tend to use different tactics.</p><p>Previously when you shared videos online, the cover was the video’s starting. Still, with passing time and new options introduced, we have an option to add a thumbnail to our videos. A thumbnail is a cover photo that previews before the video is played.</p><p>In this article, you will be taught how to add a thumbnail to a Twitter video, change it and even enhance its looks.</p><h2 id="Add-Thumbnail-to-Twitter-Videos"><a href="#Add-Thumbnail-to-Twitter-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Add Thumbnail to Twitter Videos"></a>Add Thumbnail to Twitter Videos</h2><p>If you are a regular uploader on Twitter and want to engage a larger audience, you need to have some nice features for your posts.

Then navigate to the left corner of the homepage and select ‘More’ from the various options column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-thumbnail-1.png"                      alt="Log in to Twitter"                ></p><h3 id="Step-no-3-Media-Studio-Library"><a href="#Step-no-3-Media-Studio-Library" class="headerlink" title="Step no 3: Media Studio Library"></a>Step no 3: Media Studio Library</h3><p>Select ‘Media Studio’ from the ‘More’ option, and you will be redirected to the media studio library.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-thumbnail-2.png"                      alt="Tap share"                ></p><h3 id="Step-no-4-Upload-the-Video"><a href="#Step-no-4-Upload-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step no 4: Upload the Video"></a>Step no 4: Upload the Video</h3><p>After being redirected to the Media Studio Library, you will find an Upload Video option on the right top corner.

One is to choose a frame from within the video. The other is to upload a specially designed thumbnail photo in any format.</p><p>From the Media Details menu, you can drag or play the video and then pause it at the point you find suitable to be the video’s thumbnail and then click ‘Choose.’</p><p>Or, if you want to go the other way and upload a specific thumbnail for your Twitter video, the option is just below the video’s timeline slider. Click on upload and select a photo you wish to choose as your thumbnail from your device’s internal storage and then click Choose, and that is it.</p><p>You have successfully added a thumbnail to your Twitter video.</p><p>After adding the thumbnail successfully, click on the tweet, and your video will be uploaded with the exact thumbnail you chose for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-thumbnail-4.png"                      alt="Choose Snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Change-Thumbnail-of-Twitter-Videos"><a href="#Change-Thumbnail-of-Twitter-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Change Thumbnail of Twitter Videos"></a>Change Thumbnail of Twitter Videos</h2><p>Now that you have learned how to add a thumbnail to your Twitter video, what if you want to change it?

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program.

The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man-3"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man-3" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"

Twesocial reviews would be fascinating to read in this respect. Since it was released to the public, everybody has gone wild for it. It did, however, happen gradually.</p><p>Twitter was founded in 2006, and by 2012, over 100 million users were sending around 340 million tweets every day. Twitter had the most following celebrities back in the day, with some net earnings of $1.13 billion.</p><p>You can also post media (pictures and videos) on Twitter without difficulty. Along with the tweets, videos and pictures also go viral with each passing day. Since several videos are posted every day, it’s hard to guess which one is viral these days.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what makes a viral <strong>Twitter video hot</strong>? Twitter’s hype has been boosted every day from its inception for various reasons. One of the numerous things we could question about Twitter is what are the most popular viral Twitter videos. To help you solve that question, we’ve compiled a list of the Top 10 Hot and Viral Videos on Twitter in this article. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-is-Viral-Video"><a href="#What-is-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Viral Video?"></a>What is Viral Video?</h2><p>A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.</p><p>Tweets may become viral for a variety of reasons. They might increase awareness of a problem, create arguments, or even be amusing. But what’s common in them is that they attract the users and the influencers to give their views about them.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips"><a href="#Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips"></a>Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips</h2><p>Viral videos are hard to find on other social sites, but Twitter, an open platform for all users, provides easy access to viral or trendy clips. This quality of Twitter makes it stand out from other social platforms. It helps the user find trendy fashion, sports, cooking, Hollywood, etc., with mere clicks. The following are the top 10 viral hot clips Twitter:</p><h2 id="1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look"><a href="#1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look" class="headerlink" title="1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look"></a>1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look</h2><p>This video reads, “me after seeing Billie’s pictures: #BillieEilish #BillieEilishHotWhile,” which refers to all of us. Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel" class="headerlink" title="2. Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"></a>2. <strong>Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel</strong></h3><p>This video has the caption “Lil Nas X representing the fallen angel Satan.” It was posted on May 27, 2021. However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3. Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"></a>3. <strong>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating</strong></h3><p>The title for this video hot on Twitter reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.” This video has 572K views, and it was posted on November 19, 2021.</p><p>It displays Paul Rudd laughing and replying “Not me” to the interviewer’s question, “Look at us, who would have thought?”, clearly demonstrating the fan’s feelings after hearing the news that Pete and Kim Kardashian, days after Kanye and Kim broke up.</p><p>The title for this viral Twitter video reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.”</p><p>Kim Kardashian’s divorce from Kanye West was possibly this year’s most unexpected yet unsurprising occurrence in popular culture history. According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty" class="headerlink" title="4. Children Being Naughty"></a>4. <strong>Children Being Naughty</strong></h3><p>The hot viral Twitter clip has the caption saying, “Even more reasons not to have kids.” It was uploaded on January 24, 2022, by the well-known Twitter account @LADBible. LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious. In this video, children are doing crazy stuff, such as throwing stuff at the TV, breading the father’s nose, breaking glasses, throwing cereal on the couch, punching their father in serious areas, etc. Moreover, the video has around 622K views on Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-4.png"                      alt="Children Being Naughty"                ></p><h3 id="5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues"><a href="#5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues" class="headerlink" title="5. Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues"></a>5. <strong>Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues</strong></h3><p>“Simone Biles has withdrawn from the vault and poles finals,” Justin Lee said in the video. “I believe now is a perfect time to offer Auburn trainer Jeff Graba’s description of Biles’ problems.” Everyone who has ever been a gymnast knows that when the twisties are mentioned, everyone comes to a halt. It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel.

Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-is-Viral-Video-3"><a href="#What-is-Viral-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Viral Video?"></a>What is Viral Video?</h2><p>A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.</p><p>Tweets may become viral for a variety of reasons. They might increase awareness of a problem, create arguments, or even be amusing. But what’s common in them is that they attract the users and the influencers to give their views about them.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips-3"><a href="#Top-10-Twitter-Hot-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips"></a>Top 10 Twitter Hot Clips</h2><p>Viral videos are hard to find on other social sites, but Twitter, an open platform for all users, provides easy access to viral or trendy clips. This quality of Twitter makes it stand out from other social platforms. It helps the user find trendy fashion, sports, cooking, Hollywood, etc., with mere clicks. The following are the top 10 viral hot clips Twitter:</p><h2 id="1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look-3"><a href="#1-Billie-Eilish’s-Unveils-Her-New-Look-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look"></a>1. Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look</h2><p>This video reads, “me after seeing Billie’s pictures: #BillieEilish #BillieEilishHotWhile,” which refers to all of us. Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel-3"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"></a>2. <strong>Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel</strong></h3><p>This video has the caption “Lil Nas X representing the fallen angel Satan.” It was posted on May 27, 2021. However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating-3"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"></a>3. <strong>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating</strong></h3><p>The title for this video hot on Twitter reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.” This video has 572K views, and it was posted on November 19, 2021.</p><p>It displays Paul Rudd laughing and replying “Not me” to the interviewer’s question, “Look at us, who would have thought?”, clearly demonstrating the fan’s feelings after hearing the news that Pete and Kim Kardashian, days after Kanye and Kim broke up.</p><p>The title for this viral Twitter video reads, “All of us discovering out Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are genuinely dating.”</p><p>Kim Kardashian’s divorce from Kanye West was possibly this year’s most unexpected yet unsurprising occurrence in popular culture history. According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty-3"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Children Being Naughty"></a>4. <strong>Children Being Naughty</strong></h3><p>The hot viral Twitter clip has the caption saying, “Even more reasons not to have kids.” It was uploaded on January 24, 2022, by the well-known Twitter account @LADBible. LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious. In this video, children are doing crazy stuff, such as throwing stuff at the TV, breading the father’s nose, breaking glasses, throwing cereal on the couch, punching their father in serious areas, etc. Moreover, the video has around 622K views on Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-4.png"                      alt="Children Being Naughty"                ></p><h3 id="5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues-3"><a href="#5-Jeff-Graba’s-Demonstration-of-Biles’-issues-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues"></a>5. <strong>Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues</strong></h3><p>“Simone Biles has withdrawn from the vault and poles finals,” Justin Lee said in the video. “I believe now is a perfect time to offer Auburn trainer Jeff Graba’s description of Biles’ problems.” Everyone who has ever been a gymnast knows that when the twisties are mentioned, everyone comes to a halt. It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died-3"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Mr. Big Died"></a>6. <strong>Mr. Big Died</strong></h3><p>The title for this video’s hot viral Twitter reads, “WTF #AndJustLikeThat Mr. Big is no longer alive. I assumed he was having a stroke and wondered why Carrie didn’t call for an ambulance…”.</p><p>This video was posted on December 9, 2021, with around 200K views. In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Kit Harrington Won’t Eat His Cereals"></a>7. <strong>Kit Harrington Won’t Eat His Cereals</strong></h3><p>This viral Twitter video is titled “In loving remembrance of the “Ryan Gosling won’t eat his cereal” vines.” This video was posted on May 26, 2019, from an account named Eugene Buenaventura, and it has around 1.4M Twitter views to date. In this video, Kit Harrington, known for playing John Snow in the popular TV series Game of Thrones, is offered something to eat that he is not eating.</p><p>Following a succession of six-second footage of A-list actor Ryan Gosling being fed a spoonful of breakfast cereal, this clip took its artistic expression as a famous culture treasure on Vine. The video’s caption assured that it swiftly became viral, mirroring the internet trajectory of a significant breakthrough news item.</p><p>The popularity of the Gosling viral demonstrates the importance of strategically seeding your material with the key influencers and how, in some situations, a small number of people may go worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-7.png"                      alt="Video about Kit Harrington Won&#39;t Eat His Cereals"                ></p><h3 id="8-Dove-Brand-Campaign-3"><a href="#8-Dove-Brand-Campaign-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

More on the stereotype-busting spot can be seen on @CampaignLiveUS “. It was posted on November 09, 2019, and has around 4K views to the date.</p><p>The film for Dove’s Real Beauty Sketches #WeAreBeautiful ad traveled unlike any other, thanks to a long tail of connection and strong audience reaction.</p><p>This video has shown less fatigue than the others and fewer influencer-induced spikes. Instead, the dialogue took place in clusters of towns scattered over the world, demonstrating the importance of local interaction and highlighting the practical usage of a digital outreach campaign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-8.png"                      alt="Video about Dove Brand Campaign"                ></p><h3 id="9-Cats-Defying-Laws-of-Physics-3"><a href="#9-Cats-Defying-Laws-of-Physics-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Cats Defying Laws of Physics"></a>9. <strong>Cats Defying Laws of Physics</strong></h3><p>This hot video on Twitter has the caption, “Cats defying all laws of physics.” On January 24, 2022, it was posted by a famous Twitter account named <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/ladbible/status/1485553202607108096" >@LADBible <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. LADBible has been famous for posting trendy twitter videos to entertain its followers for a long time. Moreover, this Twitter account has many followers (around 2.9M), including some celebrities.</p><p>Although the caption of the video seems a bit cheesy to you at first, you would be amazed and wonder how those cats are doing that stuff when you see the video. In the video, cats are going under the locked door, running on vertical walls, walking under the bed upside down, jumping up to the room’s roof, coming out of a thing cage, etc., which is not exactly typical for a cat do. Furthermore, this video has 270K views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-9.png"                      alt="Cats Defying Laws of Physics"                ></p><h3 id="10-Man-Eating-His-Phone-3"><a href="#10-Man-Eating-His-Phone-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

It is yet another video posted from the LADBible, a famous page on Twitter that pots trendy and viral videos to entertain its followers and let them have a good time on Twitter. This video was posted on January 24, 2021, with around 688K views.</p><p>After reading the caption, you won’t get the idea of what it is about, so we recommend watching it. However, if you’re too lazy for that, keep reading. It is a 24-second clip featuring a sleeping guy who has a pizza slice in one hand and his phone in the other. After he wakes up, he starts eating his phone instead of the pizza, which looks funny and a bit embarrassing for the man, who just got captured while doing that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-10.png"                      alt="Viral video of a Man Eating His Phone"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#How-to-Go-Viral-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Go Viral on Twitter"></a>How to Go Viral on Twitter</h2><p>With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it’s quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-3"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-3"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Share A Personal Story"></a>4. Share A Personal Story</h3><p>You can’t go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I’ve always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: [link].</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel. Learning what the viral <strong>Twitter video hot</strong> is intriguing for someone who is constantly interested in what is on-trend these days.</p><p><a class="link"

That’s The Joke</h3><p>From a line spoken by comedian Rainier Wolfcastle in a Simpsons episode, it’s a meme now used in order to either explain the punchline to a joke in a condescending manner, or it is meant to be a deadpan (or annoyed) reply to something that wouldn’t have been funny otherwise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/The-Joke-meme.JPG"                      alt="The Joke"                ></p><h3 id="3-Feels-Bad-Man-Sad-Frog"><a href="#3-Feels-Bad-Man-Sad-Frog" class="headerlink" title="3.

Nut Button"></a>3. Nut Button</h3><p>Nut Button started as a sexual meme, but it’s commonly used as a picture of someone hitting a blue or red button with a word on it. It’s accompanied by text explaining why you would want to hit that button in that context.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Nut-Button-meme.JPG"                      alt="Nut Button"                ></p><h3 id="4-Spongebob-Mock-3"><a href="#4-Spongebob-Mock-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Spongebob Mock"></a>4. Spongebob Mock</h3><p>Spongebob Mocking is a screen capture of Spongebob making a strange face and walking like a chicken. It is usually accompanied by a reply written like this: ExAmPlE tExT, which is mocking the person who said the same sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Spongebob-Mock-meme.JPG"                      alt="Spongebob Mock"                ></p><h3 id="5-Reaction-Images-3"><a href="#5-Reaction-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Reaction Images</h3><p>These images vary, but they’re usually a person with a specific expression on their face, and someone posts it as their response to something that another Twitter user has said.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Computer-Reaction-Faces-meme.JPG"                      alt="Reaction Images"                ></p><h3 id="6-Expanding-Brain-3"><a href="#6-Expanding-Brain-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Expanding Brain"></a>6. Expanding Brain</h3><p>Expanding Brain is a picture with three images of the brain; one ordinary, one slightly lit up, and then one that appears to be exploding in light. On the right hand side of the image, it’s usually something about the user’s evolving thoughts or ideas relating to a topic or how they do things.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Expanding-Brain-meme.JPG"                      alt="Expanding Brain"                ></p><h3 id="7-Demotivational-Posters-3"><a href="#7-Demotivational-Posters-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Demotivational Posters"></a>7. Demotivational Posters</h3><p>These posters, at first glance, look like motivational posters, with images of nature or animals or other beautiful things – but the text is usually something sarcastic or sardonic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Demotivational-Posters-meme.JPG"                      alt="Demotivational Posters"                ></p><h3 id="8-Cash-Me-Outside-Howbow-Dah-3"><a href="#8-Cash-Me-Outside-Howbow-Dah-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Cash Me Outside&#x2F;Howbow Dah"></a>8. Cash Me Outside&#x2F;Howbow Dah</h3><p>From a Dr. Phil episode, this picture is of an angry girl who told the audience “Catch me outside, how about that?” in a strong accent – needless to say, it’s been immortalized in memes and used when people are arguing (whether playfully or literally).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Cash-Me-Ousside-meme.JPG"                      alt="Cash Me Outside"                ></p><h3 id="9-Conceited-Reaction-3"><a href="#9-Conceited-Reaction-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Conceited Reaction"></a>9. Conceited Reaction</h3><p>The rapper Conceited is captured in this meme, looking off camera and pursing his lips in a disapproving look. Now people use it to show their disapproval or anxiety around a topic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Conceited-Reaction-meme.JPG"                      alt="Conceited Reaction"                ></p><h3 id="10-Computer-Reaction-Faces-3"><a href="#10-Computer-Reaction-Faces-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Computer Reaction Faces"></a>10.
