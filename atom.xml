Billie Eilish’s Unveils Her New Look</h2><p>This video reads, “me after seeing Billie’s pictures: #BillieEilish #BillieEilishHotWhile,” which refers to all of us. Fans were shocked when her new style was unveiled after spending most of her brief career wearing big clothing. This video, posted on May 2, 2021, has around 50K views.</p><p>While we initially thought of her as a green-haired beauty, the “Happier Than Ever” diva went platinum and ditched her baggy attire. Eilish shattered the internet when she posed on the front of British Vogue in lingerie for the May edition.</p><p>An exclusive discussion with Eilish happened shortly after she unveiled new golden tresses on Instagram, where she broke records with over 10 million likes for under 3 hours. It’s all about doing what brings you joy, and it lands Billie on the front of British Vogue Magazine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-1.png"                      alt="Billie Eilish&#39;s Unveils Her New Look"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel"><a href="#2-Lil-Nas-X-Represents-the-Fallen-Angel" class="headerlink" title="2. Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"></a>2. <strong>Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel</strong></h3><p>This video has the caption “Lil Nas X representing the fallen angel Satan.” It was posted on May 27, 2021. However, this video has not so many views, but it represents the viral conspiracy.</p><p>In 2021, the Industrial Baby rapper worked during his first full-length solo album, “Montero.” To make the moment really unforgettable, Lil Nas X proudly displayed a pregnant tummy for months before the album’s release, finally posting footage of him giving birth to commemorate.</p><p>His false pregnancy sparked outrage online, with some of his A-list contemporaries expressing their support while others cringed. “Never is [pregnancy] anything to belittle,” one commentator remarked. This, however, was not the rapper’s only internet scandal.</p><p>When Lil Nas X’s track “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was released earlier in 2021, people were split by the visual of Lil Nas X offering <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/LC2002%5F/status/1375624883896524801" >Satan a lap dance in the NSFW clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-2.png"                      alt="Lil Nas X Represents the Fallen Angel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating"><a href="#3-Kim-Kardashian-and-Pete-Davidson-Are-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3.

According to Page Six, the freshly minted lawyer wants to concentrate on the bar test and has grown up, but Kanye is thinking about running for the presidency and spouting other ridiculous things, and she’s had enough of it.</p><p>But as quickly as Kim K was single again, she set her sights on “SNL” star Pete Davidson. It was, predictably, the word of the (Twitter) town.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-3.png"                      alt="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Are Dating"                ></p><h3 id="4-Children-Being-Naughty"><a href="#4-Children-Being-Naughty" class="headerlink" title="4.

LADBible is well-known for providing innovative Twitter videos to keep its fans entertained for an extended period. Furthermore, this Twitter account has many followers (about 2.9 million), including several celebrities.</p><p>The caption is on the funny side, so don’t get serious.

Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues"></a>5. <strong>Jeff Graba’s Demonstration of Biles’ issues</strong></h3><p>“Simone Biles has withdrawn from the vault and poles finals,” Justin Lee said in the video. “I believe now is a perfect time to offer Auburn trainer Jeff Graba’s description of Biles’ problems.” Everyone who has ever been a gymnast knows that when the twisties are mentioned, everyone comes to a halt. It’s a tremendous problem.”</p><p>This video was posted in July 2021 and had around 25K views. In this video, the coach explains the reasons and the issues behind Simeone Bile’s tragic exit from the Olympics this summer.</p><p>When Simone Biles withdrew from the Olympics this summer due to twisties, people were either ready to support her or quick to take a shot at the medal-winning gymnast. Those who didn’t grasp the gymnastics phrase twisties labeled her a loser, but her ardent supporters defended her and snarled at internet trolls. Simone Biles has made the decision to prioritize her health.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-5.png"                      alt="Jeff Graba&#39;s Demonstration of Biles&#39; issues"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Mr-Big-Died"><a href="#6-Mr-Big-Died" class="headerlink" title="6.

I assumed he was having a stroke and wondered why Carrie didn’t call for an ambulance…”.</p><p>This video was posted on December 9, 2021, with around 200K views. In this video, a man got up in frustration and asked, “What?” which perfectly explains the fan’s emotions after Mr. Big died in the 2nd episode of Sex and The City Reboot.</p><p>Fans were outraged when “And Just Like That” killed off “Sex and the City” star Mr. Big with a heart attack caused by a Peloton. (Cue Peloton’s stock plummeting.) The agony, however, was short-lived as star Chris Noth was charged with sexually abusing many women. He has rejected the charges but has since vanished from Peloton’s stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-video-hot-6.png"                      alt="Mr. Big Died"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals"><a href="#7-Kit-Harrington-Won’t-Eat-His-Cereals" class="headerlink" title="7.

However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it’s simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Use-Hashtags-1"><a href="#1-Use-Hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Hashtags"></a>1. Use Hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets’ range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.</p><p>You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.</p><h3 id="2-Inject-Humor-1"><a href="#2-Inject-Humor-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Inject Humor"></a>2. Inject Humor</h3><p>Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don’t have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.</p><h3 id="3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-1"><a href="#3-Keep-the-Caption-Short-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Keep the Caption Short"></a>3. Keep the Caption Short</h3><p>Even if Twitter’s total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3"><a href="#4-Share-A-Personal-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

You need to place the Tweet video or image on the video track and then place your reaction video directly above it. The top video should be in a larger size so make sure to adjust its size by clicking on the video and opening it in the preview. Now, drag the handles inward or outward to position the video.</p><p><strong>● Step 3: Use editing tools</strong></p><p>There are over 60 motion effects, numerous transitions, and visual effects to add flair and appeal to your reaction video.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable"><a href="#●-Be-relatable" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Elite.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-Use-your-body"><a href="#●-Use-your-body" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions.

You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip.

Most people simply decide to use another social network that doesn’t have the limitations imposed by a misguided company management and users that lack respect for everyone’s right to free speech.</p><h2 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h2><p>The world’s fascination with Twitter was well-deserved because this social network offered unique features that actually foster public discussions and that can enable marketers to reach more users of the products they are advertising. Ten years ago, Twitter was one of the rare platforms that offered these opportunities, but today there are countless social media networks which provide the same service while making sure that their users are happy.</p><h4 id="1-Tumblr"><a href="#1-Tumblr" class="headerlink" title="1. Tumblr"></a>1. Tumblr</h4><p>Tumblr is only a year younger than Twitter, and on April 8.2018 it hosted as many as 406.9 million blogs. Tumblr apps are available on both Android and iOS-based devices, which makes it available to the almost entire online community. The micro-blogging platform focuses on visual content more than on words, and for that reason, it has become an inexhaustible source of images that can be shared on downloaded.</p><p>The Tumbler’s editorial policy prevents open support for suicide or any form of self-harm, but it doesn’t place any other hard restrictions on the platform’s users. The visual nature of platform makes it a perfect tool for promotion of products and services. Tumblr is much more than a simple platform that lets you create photo and video collections because it provides the tools necessary for the online promotion of brands.</p><h4 id="2-Plurk"><a href="#2-Plurk" class="headerlink" title="2. Plurk"></a>2. Plurk</h4><p>For years, Plurk offered the service that is nearly identical to the ones provided by Twitter, and it increased the number of character you can use in a post to 360 just a few years ago. Nearly 70% of all the traffic on the platform comes from Taiwan, so if you are targeting markets in Western Europe or the United States, Plurk may not be the best social network for you.</p><p>Plurk features a horizontal timeline and it lets you share pictures, videos or URLs for web-based articles. The platform stimulates its users to spend more time engaging with other Plurk members through the concept of Karma, which grants you access to more emoticons. This social network can be accessed from iPhones, Android devices or from PC or Mac computers.</p><h4 id="3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok"><a href="#3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="3.

Even though teenagers use it, the platform provides some interesting and amusing features that foster artistic expression and allow you to share your creative output with millions of people. Twitter users often share songs and videos posted on Musical.ly, so why not leave Twitter and start sharing your own creative content on this social media network.</p><p>Musical.ly lets you record songs, conversations, and all types of audio-visual content, but in order to access it, you must first install the app on your Android or iPhone device.

Gab.ai</h4><p>Free speech supporters are going to love using Gab.ai, a social network that has had their mobile app banned from both Google Play and the App Store, for failing to comply with their policies on adult content. Be it as it may, Gab.ai still offers shelter to people who think that hate speech or non-art related public nudity is somehow okay in the public domain. However, you really have to look for unsavory content, and most of the posts on the platform are dedicated to memes, pop culture or art.</p><p>Gab.ai doesn’t support ads, so it isn’t the best choice for companies and independent entrepreneurs who want to advertise their products or reach new markets. However, posts that get a lot of views and comments, do earn money, although the platform doesn’t support conventional online marketing techniques.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram"><a href="#5-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram"></a>5. Instagram</h4><p>People who enjoy sharing a photo on Twitter from time to time should switch to Instagram because the platform provides much more photo editing features. In addition to amazing photo effects you can use on Instagram, you can post videos, which last up to sixty seconds or Stories that also last less than one minute. The platform’s aspect ratio restrictions have been lifted so, you can post square, horizontally and vertically oriented images or videos.</p><p>Even though you can access Instagram from a Mac or PC computer, you have to install the app for iPhones or Android phones in order to be able to post new content on Instagram. The social media platform supports sponsored content as well as ads, which makes it a perfect choice for everyone who wants to develop their business.</p><p>What is your favorite Twitter alternative?

Be it as it may, Gab.ai still offers shelter to people who think that hate speech or non-art related public nudity is somehow okay in the public domain. However, you really have to look for unsavory content, and most of the posts on the platform are dedicated to memes, pop culture or art.</p><p>Gab.ai doesn’t support ads, so it isn’t the best choice for companies and independent entrepreneurs who want to advertise their products or reach new markets.

The platform’s aspect ratio restrictions have been lifted so, you can post square, horizontally and vertically oriented images or videos.</p><p>Even though you can access Instagram from a Mac or PC computer, you have to install the app for iPhones or Android phones in order to be able to post new content on Instagram.

Eight years later, things seem as if they took the turn for the worse because the number of the platform’s monthly users is shrinking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-monthly-active-users.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4727541&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/copy_copy_forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Gold Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In the last quarter of 2017, Twitter had only 330 million users, much less than Facebook that had 2,07 billion users or Instagram that had approximately 700 million users over that same period. Despite being easy to use and a powerful tool for reaching like-minded people or potential customers for your company’s products Twitter is slowly losing the reputation it once had.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.devart.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=5023555&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/45b430710ad04765a6afd58d9d9fafca/products/dotConnect_O.png"                      border="0"                >dotConnect for Oracle is an ADO.NET data provider for Oracle with Entity Framework Support.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Leave-Twitter-3"><a href="#Why-Leave-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Leave Twitter?"></a>Why Leave Twitter?</h2><p>At the end of the last year, the platform has increased the number of characters that can be used in a post, but this move did almost nothing to restore Twitter’s former glory. Celebrities getting caught up in Twitter wars, fake accounts and ultra-right-wing supporters have all contributed to the current state of affairs on Twitter. Most people simply decide to use another social network that doesn’t have the limitations imposed by a misguided company management and users that lack respect for everyone’s right to free speech.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-4"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-4" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h2><p>The world’s fascination with Twitter was well-deserved because this social network offered unique features that actually foster public discussions and that can enable marketers to reach more users of the products they are advertising. Ten years ago, Twitter was one of the rare platforms that offered these opportunities, but today there are countless social media networks which provide the same service while making sure that their users are happy.</p><h4 id="1-Tumblr-3"><a href="#1-Tumblr-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Tumblr"></a>1. Tumblr</h4><p>Tumblr is only a year younger than Twitter, and on April 8.2018 it hosted as many as 406.9 million blogs. Tumblr apps are available on both Android and iOS-based devices, which makes it available to the almost entire online community. The micro-blogging platform focuses on visual content more than on words, and for that reason, it has become an inexhaustible source of images that can be shared on downloaded.</p><p>The Tumbler’s editorial policy prevents open support for suicide or any form of self-harm, but it doesn’t place any other hard restrictions on the platform’s users. The visual nature of platform makes it a perfect tool for promotion of products and services. Tumblr is much more than a simple platform that lets you create photo and video collections because it provides the tools necessary for the online promotion of brands.</p><h4 id="2-Plurk-3"><a href="#2-Plurk-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Plurk"></a>2. Plurk</h4><p>For years, Plurk offered the service that is nearly identical to the ones provided by Twitter, and it increased the number of character you can use in a post to 360 just a few years ago. Nearly 70% of all the traffic on the platform comes from Taiwan, so if you are targeting markets in Western Europe or the United States, Plurk may not be the best social network for you.</p><p>Plurk features a horizontal timeline and it lets you share pictures, videos or URLs for web-based articles. The platform stimulates its users to spend more time engaging with other Plurk members through the concept of Karma, which grants you access to more emoticons. This social network can be accessed from iPhones, Android devices or from PC or Mac computers.</p><h4 id="3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok-3"><a href="#3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)"></a>3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)</h4><p>If you have never heard of this social network you may be getting a bit old, because most users of Musical.ly are aged between 13 and 18. Even though teenagers use it, the platform provides some interesting and amusing features that foster artistic expression and allow you to share your creative output with millions of people. Twitter users often share songs and videos posted on Musical.ly, so why not leave Twitter and start sharing your own creative content on this social media network.</p><p>Musical.ly lets you record songs, conversations, and all types of audio-visual content, but in order to access it, you must first install the app on your Android or iPhone device. Although it doesn’t offer the same features as Twitter, Musical.ly is still an interesting alternative for this declining social network.</p><h4 id="4-Gab-ai-3"><a href="#4-Gab-ai-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-2"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-2" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-2"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-2" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36506229&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><video width="100%" height="" class="rounded-t-md shadow-lg relative z-20" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" webkit-playinginline=""></p><source type="video/mp4" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.mp4"><source type="video/webm" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.webm"></video></a><!-- affiliate ads end -->### ● The tone is everything<p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-3"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-3" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-3"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously.

If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well.

No, the idea is not to copy the Twitter videos, Tiktok Viral clips and do something you do not want to do. Instead, you can take inspiration from these popular TikTok videos viral on Twitter and know what makes a clip popular among the users.</p><p>Most people think that making videos on TikTok is easy and superficial. After all, the videos, on average, are about 10 seconds long. But upon downloading the application, you will soon start feeling lost. Those 10 seconds become the hardest to shoot. And why not? Millions of people globally are competing to create something new, simple, and creative, something that not only engages the audience but also forces them to rewatch, like, share, and comment on the clip.</p><p>Wann’ know how to create something simple yet trend-worthy on TikTok? Take inspiration from these top ten TikTok viral videos that rule Twitter in 2022.</p><h2 id="1-Zach-King’s-Harry-Potter-doing-the-laundry"><a href="#1-Zach-King’s-Harry-Potter-doing-the-laundry" class="headerlink" title="1.

With over 2.8 Billion views, Zach King flying on a broom is the most-watched video on TikTok. And for a reason: be it the caption or video, every second of it is enough to awe the user.</p><p>Zach currently has over 66 Million followers on TikTok, and a hefty number of followers came after his enthralling Harry Potter video with the caption: “They rejected my application to Hogwarts, but I still found a way to be a wizard.”</p><p>In the video, Zach is flying on the broom in the first part, whereas the second part reveals the illusion. Zach can be seen with a mirror and a fake leg hanging on it, and he is moving on a skateboard. So, there you go! A little bit of cleverness and the shame of having to reveal your trick is all it takes to make your video the most-watched video on TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/zachking/status/1204490381200506880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1204698987325837313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2019/12/11/incredible-harry-potter-broom-trick/" >Zach King’s Harry Potter Illusion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones"><a href="#2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones" class="headerlink" title="2.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content. The lesson to learn here is although a clip of mere seconds, creators should put effort and time and really feel like shooting a real movie. And only when you shoot videos with this kind of spirit expect them to go viral.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@totouchanemu/video/6990181852803894533?is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6981905548543346181" >David Allen Dancing with Drones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”"><a href="#3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”" class="headerlink" title="3.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings" class="headerlink" title="4.

And Franek Bielak uses the platform just for that. Show his talent: drawings. One of the top influencers (of his realm) on TikTok, Franek Biekal’s “This is one of my best drawings” video, is one of the most liked videos on the platform with over 44 million likes. The video pleads users continuously with messages like “Please watch till the end,” “Is worth it,” and Franek shows the drawing process with a low rhythm playing in the background.</p><p>If you are good at something, TikTok can indeed make you famous. But note that Franke shared a lot of his drawings before reaping the rewards via this one. And the reason to attach Franek to this Twitter video viral TikTok 2022 list is to motivate you to share your talents with the users on TikTok and not lose hope.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fredziownik%5Fart/video/6911406868699073798?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6919038900356089349&is_from_webapp=v3&is_copy_url=0" >Franek Bielak Drawings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Billie-Eilish’s-first-TikTok-video"><a href="#5-Billie-Eilish’s-first-TikTok-video" class="headerlink" title="5.

There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-1"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

The video pleads users continuously with messages like “Please watch till the end,” “Is worth it,” and Franek shows the drawing process with a low rhythm playing in the background.</p><p>If you are good at something, TikTok can indeed make you famous. But note that Franke shared a lot of his drawings before reaping the rewards via this one.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content. The lesson to learn here is although a clip of mere seconds, creators should put effort and time and really feel like shooting a real movie.

Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-2"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

And only when you shoot videos with this kind of spirit expect them to go viral.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@totouchanemu/video/6990181852803894533?is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6981905548543346181" >David Allen Dancing with Drones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”-3"><a href="#3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-3"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

And Franek Bielak uses the platform just for that. Show his talent: drawings. One of the top influencers (of his realm) on TikTok, Franek Biekal’s “This is one of my best drawings” video, is one of the most liked videos on the platform with over 44 million likes. The video pleads users continuously with messages like “Please watch till the end,” “Is worth it,” and Franek shows the drawing process with a low rhythm playing in the background.</p><p>If you are good at something, TikTok can indeed make you famous. But note that Franke shared a lot of his drawings before reaping the rewards via this one. And the reason to attach Franek to this Twitter video viral TikTok 2022 list is to motivate you to share your talents with the users on TikTok and not lose hope.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fredziownik%5Fart/video/6911406868699073798?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6919038900356089349&is_from_webapp=v3&is_copy_url=0" >Franek Bielak Drawings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Billie-Eilish’s-first-TikTok-video-3"><a href="#5-Billie-Eilish’s-first-TikTok-video-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

No, the idea is not to copy the Twitter videos, Tiktok Viral clips and do something you do not want to do. Instead, you can take inspiration from these popular TikTok videos viral on Twitter and know what makes a clip popular among the users.</p><p>Most people think that making videos on TikTok is easy and superficial. After all, the videos, on average, are about 10 seconds long. But upon downloading the application, you will soon start feeling lost. Those 10 seconds become the hardest to shoot. And why not? Millions of people globally are competing to create something new, simple, and creative, something that not only engages the audience but also forces them to rewatch, like, share, and comment on the clip.</p><p>Wann’ know how to create something simple yet trend-worthy on TikTok? Take inspiration from these top ten TikTok viral videos that rule Twitter in 2022.</p><h2 id="1-Zach-King’s-Harry-Potter-doing-the-laundry"><a href="#1-Zach-King’s-Harry-Potter-doing-the-laundry" class="headerlink" title="1.

With over 2.8 Billion views, Zach King flying on a broom is the most-watched video on TikTok. And for a reason: be it the caption or video, every second of it is enough to awe the user.</p><p>Zach currently has over 66 Million followers on TikTok, and a hefty number of followers came after his enthralling Harry Potter video with the caption: “They rejected my application to Hogwarts, but I still found a way to be a wizard.”</p><p>In the video, Zach is flying on the broom in the first part, whereas the second part reveals the illusion. Zach can be seen with a mirror and a fake leg hanging on it, and he is moving on a skateboard. So, there you go! A little bit of cleverness and the shame of having to reveal your trick is all it takes to make your video the most-watched video on TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/zachking/status/1204490381200506880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1204698987325837313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2019/12/11/incredible-harry-potter-broom-trick/" >Zach King’s Harry Potter Illusion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones"><a href="#2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones" class="headerlink" title="2.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content. The lesson to learn here is although a clip of mere seconds, creators should put effort and time and really feel like shooting a real movie. And only when you shoot videos with this kind of spirit expect them to go viral.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@totouchanemu/video/6990181852803894533?is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6981905548543346181" >David Allen Dancing with Drones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”"><a href="#3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”" class="headerlink" title="3.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings" class="headerlink" title="4.

And Franek Bielak uses the platform just for that. Show his talent: drawings. One of the top influencers (of his realm) on TikTok, Franek Biekal’s “This is one of my best drawings” video, is one of the most liked videos on the platform with over 44 million likes. The video pleads users continuously with messages like “Please watch till the end,” “Is worth it,” and Franek shows the drawing process with a low rhythm playing in the background.</p><p>If you are good at something, TikTok can indeed make you famous. But note that Franke shared a lot of his drawings before reaping the rewards via this one. And the reason to attach Franek to this Twitter video viral TikTok 2022 list is to motivate you to share your talents with the users on TikTok and not lose hope.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fredziownik%5Fart/video/6911406868699073798?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6919038900356089349&is_from_webapp=v3&is_copy_url=0" >Franek Bielak Drawings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="5-Billie-Eilish’s-first-TikTok-video"><a href="#5-Billie-Eilish’s-first-TikTok-video" class="headerlink" title="5.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content.

Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><h3 id="200610"><a class="link"   href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/200610/3022" >Parental Control Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><span class="text-ad-content">    #1 Rated Parental Control Software.<br/>    Monitor & Control all PC Activity!<br/>        <cite style="color:green">sentrypc.com/parental-controls/</cite>    </span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/200610/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## 4\.

The video pleads users continuously with messages like “Please watch till the end,” “Is worth it,” and Franek shows the drawing process with a low rhythm playing in the background.</p><p>If you are good at something, TikTok can indeed make you famous. But note that Franke shared a lot of his drawings before reaping the rewards via this one.

A little bit of cleverness and the shame of having to reveal your trick is all it takes to make your video the most-watched video on TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/zachking/status/1204490381200506880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1204698987325837313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2019/12/11/incredible-harry-potter-broom-trick/" >Zach King’s Harry Potter Illusion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones-3"><a href="#2-David-Allen’s-Dancing-with-Drones-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

In fact, it became the video of the year in America and the world as far as TikTok is concerned.</p><p>Of course, it is not the first video on TikTok where a creator is dancing to the beat of Stay. There are thousands, if not million videos. But what made this clip stand out is the use of drones. Yes, Allen utilizes a drone to film his hip-swaying and unique moves and captioned it: “Drone Dancing.”</p><p>Before filming this explosive content, David believed he was posting low-effort content. The lesson to learn here is although a clip of mere seconds, creators should put effort and time and really feel like shooting a real movie. And only when you shoot videos with this kind of spirit expect them to go viral.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@totouchanemu/video/6990181852803894533?is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6981905548543346181" >David Allen Dancing with Drones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”-2"><a href="#3-Bella-Porch’s-“M-to-the-B”-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

No insult to Bella and her videos, but how can a simple lip-syncing video be the most liked video of the year on TikTok? Is it the cosplay of algorithms? Or is it Bella’s charm that has already managed to get her quite a fan following? Because it was not only TikTok that Bella ruled with this video. It also became a sensation on Twitter, and you could easily find it by typing simple keywords like Twitter video viral 2022 TikTok on Google.</p><p>Well, the answer is to post regularly! Because you never know what could attract the audience and make you an overnight success. Yes, lip-sync of M to the B certainly is not something that requires much of an effort. At least, from an influencer of Bella’s stature. Still, you cannot disregard the time and effort of the creator in her other works on the platforms.</p><p>In all, if you continue to make videos on a daily basis — the good ones — then you will have the authority to make a simple video and make it the most liked video of the year.</p><p>Here’s a link to the video:</p><p><a href="#/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445">Bella Porch’s M to the B</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-2"><a href="#4-Franek-Bielak’s-Drawings-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, even if each platform has its own vibe, it’s also true that content going viral on one platform will most likely be adored on the other platform as well.</p><p>This article will teach you how to share a Twitter video on Instagram and Instagram story. You can post on Twitter and Facebook together with one click and save a lot of time.</p><h2 id="Importance-of-Posting-Across-Multiple-Platforms"><a href="#Importance-of-Posting-Across-Multiple-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Posting Across Multiple Platforms"></a>Importance of Posting Across Multiple Platforms</h2><p>If you are new to social media or simply new to blogging, then this article will guide you on how to post your content on Twitter and Instagram simultaneously. Even while scrolling, if you come across an exciting video that you would like to post on your Instagram you can easily do that using one of the methods below. But, why would one want to post the same post on Twitter and then on Instagram?</p><h3 id="Reach-a-Wider-Audience"><a href="#Reach-a-Wider-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Reach a Wider Audience"></a>Reach a Wider Audience</h3><p>Your friends on multiple platforms might not be the same, with each social media having its own style. Posting a video from Twitter to Instagram might reach an entirely different audience than Twitter with the varying algorithms. This will help reach a larger audience, and people can enjoy your content on any social media app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Social-Media-Strategy"><a href="#Social-Media-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Social Media Strategy"></a>Social Media Strategy</h3><p>Cross-posting is a very effective social media strategy that allows you to streamline your content and repurpose your content across all platforms. This will increase brand awareness and ensure people view your content and don’t miss out on it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Keeps-Social-Media-Up-to-Date"><a href="#Keeps-Social-Media-Up-to-Date" class="headerlink" title="Keeps Social Media Up to Date"></a>Keeps Social Media Up to Date</h3><p>Cross posting also helps in keeping all social media up to date.

This makes Instagram also more photo and video-friendly.</p><p>Now that you are familiar with all the benefits of cross-posting Twitter videos to Instagram, you can learn how to do that in quick and easy steps.</p><p>Instagram stories are also a very interactive feature that allow you to post content that will stay on your profile for just 24 hours and then get deleted automatically. You can post your Twitter video on Instagram stories if you don’t want to post the video permanently on your profile. Here is how you can post Twitter videos on Instagram stories:</p><h3 id="1-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Instagram-Story-Chrome"><a href="#1-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Instagram-Story-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="1.

Share Twitter Videos on Instagram Story Chrome</h3><p>While you always have the option of posting the Twitter video link on your Instagram story, this is not the same as posting as video. The link will lead them back to Twitter to watch the video, and people rarely open links to watch something.

It’s an amazingly edited compilation of his best moments and shows what makes him the greatest quarterback in the history of American football. Tom Brady can be seen talking that he loves nothing more than the game he plays and the stats confirm this. He has the most number of touchdowns and passes than anyone in the NFL.</p><h3 id="7-Subway-work-collapse-3"><a href="#7-Subway-work-collapse-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

It happened early in the morning so there was no traffic on the road and no harm occurred. However, the express lane was later opened for traffic after the completion of repair work.

The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material.

While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-1"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-1" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship.

But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-Be-relatable"><a href="#●-Be-relatable" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-Use-your-body"><a href="#●-Use-your-body" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects"><a href="#●-Use-effects" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything-1"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything-1" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-1"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-1" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-1"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-1" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body-1"><a href="#●-Use-your-body-1" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background-1"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background-1" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions.

Euphoria Season 2 Trailer<p>The caption of this twitter video reads, “this season on #EUPHORIA…”. This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material.

Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

I’m hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7. Video bitrate limit on Twitter</strong></p><p>Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter"><a href="#Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Specifications for Twitter"></a>Best Video Specifications for Twitter</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Best Format Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1280x720, 720x1280, 720x720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 or 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Minimum)</strong></td><td>5000 kbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Maximum)</strong></td><td>128 kbps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With video consumption increasing year after year, Twitter video helps you to remain current and attract an audience that values video content for knowledge. Purchase intent rises by 34% when videos are shared on Twitter. In truth, Twitter is about far more than 280 characters: it’s about telling a narrative, your story.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?"></a>Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?</h2><p>Both Twitter In-feed videos and Twitter video advertising have comparable video specs, which is fortunate for you. However, we’ll still go through the Twitter video criteria for each of them, as well as some best practices for increasing interaction. It’s critical to understand the proper Twitter video specifications, such as the maximum size limit, format, and aspect ratios. By keeping an eye out for things like these, you can guarantee <strong>how to post videos on Twitter</strong> in the best possible form for a better watching experience.</p><ul><li>Never exceed a frame of 30 frames per second. Although Twitter can accept files with a frame rate of 40 frames per second, limiting your video to 30 frames per second will ensure cross-channel compatibility.</li></ul><h2 id="1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC"><a href="#1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC" class="headerlink" title="1.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-1"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7.

This isn’t to say that you won’t be able to complete the task. All you have to do now is be creative with the tools you do have. When making, modifying, and publishing videos to Twitter, whether on a smartphone or a computer, keep these <strong>best formats for Twitter videos</strong> in mind.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-2"><a href="#In-this-article-2" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-2"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7. Video bitrate limit on Twitter</strong></p><p>Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-2"><a href="#Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-2" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Specifications for Twitter"></a>Best Video Specifications for Twitter</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Best Format Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1280x720, 720x1280, 720x720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 or 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Minimum)</strong></td><td>5000 kbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Maximum)</strong></td><td>128 kbps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With video consumption increasing year after year, Twitter video helps you to remain current and attract an audience that values video content for knowledge. Purchase intent rises by 34% when videos are shared on Twitter. In truth, Twitter is about far more than 280 characters: it’s about telling a narrative, your story.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, we’ll still go through the Twitter video criteria for each of them, as well as some best practices for increasing interaction. It’s critical to understand the proper Twitter video specifications, such as the maximum size limit, format, and aspect ratios. By keeping an eye out for things like these, you can guarantee <strong>how to post videos on Twitter</strong> in the best possible form for a better watching experience.</p><ul><li>Never exceed a frame of 30 frames per second.

This isn’t to say that you won’t be able to complete the task. All you have to do now is be creative with the tools you do have. When making, modifying, and publishing videos to Twitter, whether on a smartphone or a computer, keep these <strong>best formats for Twitter videos</strong> in mind. They’re important for a pleasant user experience and the success of your profile. If all of the above seems like too much trouble, you can always hire someone to perform the task for you.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7. Video bitrate limit on Twitter</strong></p><p>Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Specifications for Twitter"></a>Best Video Specifications for Twitter</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Best Format Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1280x720, 720x1280, 720x720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 or 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Minimum)</strong></td><td>5000 kbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Maximum)</strong></td><td>128 kbps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With video consumption increasing year after year, Twitter video helps you to remain current and attract an audience that values video content for knowledge. Purchase intent rises by 34% when videos are shared on Twitter. In truth, Twitter is about far more than 280 characters: it’s about telling a narrative, your story.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-spreadsheet-free-excel-editor-online-offline-1x.93e269d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This is now only accessible for iOS users, but Android users should get it shortly.</p><ul><li>Launch Twitter</li></ul><p>On your iOS smartphone, open the Twitter app from your Home and click on the Tweet button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/upload-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="upload videos"                ></p><ul><li>Open Tweet settings</li></ul><p>To access the settings, tap the menu and select the video caption as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/upload-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="upload videos"                ></p><ul><li>Select Data Usage</li></ul><p>Scroll down to the Data Usage section.

This isn’t to say that you won’t be able to complete the task. All you have to do now is be creative with the tools you do have. When making, modifying, and publishing videos to Twitter, whether on a smartphone or a computer, keep these <strong>best formats for Twitter videos</strong> in mind. They’re important for a pleasant user experience and the success of your profile. If all of the above seems like too much trouble, you can always hire someone to perform the task for you. There are plenty of firms that can make videos that get your brand recognized, in the right file format, and optimized to meet all of Twitter’s video requirements.</p><p><a class="link"
