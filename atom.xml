Twitter also says that having products with human touch or any association with them resulted in an overall response increase by 40 %.</p><p>So you should ensure that your video has a positive human engagement and desire for the product in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-4.jpg"                      alt="maximum twitter video size"                ></p><h3 id="3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach-3"><a href="#3-Add-Hashtags-to-increase-your-reach-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach"></a>3. Add Hashtags to increase your reach</h3><p>Hashtags are very common on Twitter, and you will rarely find videos that do not have hashtags. This feature is very helpful because it helps you classify your videos, making them quick to access.</p><p>Many hashtags might be used on a post, but when it comes to Twitter, less is more. So try to stick to 1-2 important hashtags in your Twitter copy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-3.jpg"                      alt="use trending hashtags for twitter"                ></p><h3 id="4-Flash-that-Logo-3"><a href="#4-Flash-that-Logo-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Flash that Logo"></a>4. Flash that Logo</h3><p>Twitter recommends that brands place their logos within their video frame and just immediately at the start of the video to drive brand association from the beginning. When logos are placed evidently, the brand recall will increase by 30%.</p><p>You can also put your logo in the upper right or left-hand corner of your video to increase the chances of the brand recall but make sure it is in a more catchy position.</p><h3 id="5-Include-Captions-3"><a href="#5-Include-Captions-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Include Captions"></a>5. Include Captions</h3><p>93% of videos on Twitter are viewed through mobile phones; therefore, it’s important to have a video accompanied by sound. This is because many people use Twitter and other social media when they are on the go, and in some cases, they might not access sound.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to use captions and other forms of text to give your video more context so that the viewers can better understand the context.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-aspe%20ct-ratio-1.jpg"                      alt="add captions in twitter video"                ></p><h3 id="6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool-3"><a href="#6-Use-the-Filmora-video-editing-tool-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

As a result, Twitter feeds are full of brands and marketers strictly uploading links to their websites for marketing purposes.</p><p>However, some top brands do not allow broadcasting messages on their sites. But if you aim to develop your audience or use Twitter for roles other than brand messaging, you have to engage.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>There are approximately 330 million active users on Twitter each month; with such a big number, your organic post might easily get lost in the crowd. So, selling video ads as an investment should consider getting your brand to the next level. On the other hand, ensure that you follow all the required video specifications for each Twitter video. This is because the last thing you want is an attractive video that cannot be posted. After all, it has the wrong aspect ratio for Twitter video or wrong Twitter video file size. In this case, you need Filmora to resize your videos easily.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

Videos are chosen by a significant majority of people on all social media platforms. But why is this the case?</p><p>Consumers favor videos because they are simple to consume, grasp, and comprehend. In contrast, video producers prefer videos because they know that their content is available to everyone with an internet connection.</p><p>Twitter also keeps up with the times. In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a ‘renowned’ Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.</p><p>To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 <strong>Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</strong>. Let’s dive in.</p><h2 id="What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’"><a href="#What-is-‘Most-Viewed-’" class="headerlink" title="What is ‘Most Viewed?’"></a>What is ‘Most Viewed?’</h2><p>Even though this is hardly rocket science for many, some people continue to conflate the terms’ most watched’ and ‘viral.’ So, what is it that distinguishes the worlds of the two? It’s as easy as the number of views!</p><p>When a video is deemed the ‘most viewed,’ it means that it is currently leading the pack in terms of the number of people who have seen it compared to all other videos on the platform.</p><h2 id="10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#10-Most-Viewed-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter"></a>10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter</h2><h3 id="1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz"><a href="#1-Messi’s-Astonishing-Nutmeg-on-Filipe-Luiz" class="headerlink" title="1. Messi’s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz"></a>1. <strong>Messi’s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz</strong></h3><p>This is the most viewed twitter video of 2022. This video’s caption says, “Lionel still needs to explain how he did this.” This video was posted on January 25, 2022, with around 4.7M views in just two days. This video features Filipe Luiz of Atletico de Madrid getting nutmegged by Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona. Nutmeg is the term used when a ball goes through the legs of the player. It is considered one of the most humiliating things in football for an opponent player.</p><p>Lionel Messi, an Argentinian International, is regarded as one of the best players the footballing world has ever seen. He is a seven times Ballon D’or and a six times FIFA THE BEST award winner. Messi was an integral part of FC Barcelona’s glory period.</p><p>Now, getting back to the video, in the video, Messi is seen nutmegging the Atletico de Madrid’s left-back by the body faint, which was never seen before in football history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-1.png"                      alt="Messi&#39;s Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz"                ></p><h3 id="2-A-Metaverse-Prison-Yard-Virtual-Video-By-Elon-Musk"><a href="#2-A-Metaverse-Prison-Yard-Virtual-Video-By-Elon-Musk" class="headerlink" title="2. **A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"></a>2. **<strong>A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk</strong></h3><p>Well, Elon Musk needs no introduction. Still, for those who don’t know the man, Elon Musk is a flamboyant entrepreneur best known as the co-founder of PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA) and the creator of SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, among other ventures. He happens to have tweeted one of the most viewed Twitter videos in 2022.</p><p>He now works as the CEO of Tesla and the CEO and chief designer of SpaceX. He is expected to have a total net worth of $151 billion by 2022. Only Jeff Bezos comes close to him in terms of wealth as the world’s wealthiest person. The rest, you can figure out…</p><p>As for the video, which has gathered a total of 4.6M on Twitter, it says: “me fighting in the metaverse prison yard where I’m doing time for screenshotting nfts.”</p><p>NFTs and Metaverse, we are stepping into a virtual world, aren’t we?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-2.png"                      alt="Video of A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><h3 id="3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX"><a href="#3-Falcon-9’s-Landing-by-SpaceX" class="headerlink" title="3. **Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX"></a>3. **<strong>Falcon 9’s Landing by SpaceX</strong></h3><p>SpaceX’s Falcon 9 medium-lift launch system is a partly reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift spacecraft developed and constructed in the United States. The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.</p><p>As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.</p><p>And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9’s first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.</p><p>Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-3.png"                      alt="A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk"                ></p><h3 id="4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer"><a href="#4-Euphoria-Season-2-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="4. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"></a>4. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer</h3><p>The caption of this twitter video reads, “this season on #EUPHORIA…”. This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.</p><p>Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is.

But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-2" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.</p><p>This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song ‘Call Me Irresponsible,’ until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya’s voiceover tells: “Everything seems so definite when you’re younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away.” This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/most-viewed-twitter-video-4.png"                      alt="Euphoria Season 2 Trailer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3"><a href="#5-Looking-Into-2022-From-Bill-Gates-3" class="headerlink" title="5. **Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates"></a>5. **<strong>Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates</strong></h3><p>Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy.

Since 2010 the Twitter’s own advertising platform has enabled countless businesses of all sizes to reach new markets, extend their target audiences and generate profit. From the start, the platform fostered a brand-friendly atmosphere that helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.</p><p> More than half of social media managers think that Twitter is the platform that leads the market in terms of return of investment since 94 percent of the social network’s users have claimed that they planned to buy a product after discovering it on Twitter. In this article, we are going to show you how to advertise on Twitter.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter"><a href="#Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Types of Advertising on Twitter"></a>Types of Advertising on Twitter</h2><p> If your company has reached the decision to start advertising on Twitter, there are three different ways in which you can accomplish this. Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts all offer different opportunities, so let’s take a closer look at each of these options.</p><h4 id="1-Promoted-Accounts"><a href="#1-Promoted-Accounts" class="headerlink" title="1. Promoted Accounts"></a>1. Promoted Accounts</h4><p> As much as 85 percent of users have reported that promoted accounts helped them find new businesses that offer products they were looking for. The true purpose of promoted accounts is to make your Twitter account visible to the audience you targeted and gain more followers in such a manner.</p><p> Promoted accounts appear in timelines of Twitter users that fit in your target group and they also appear in Who to Follow recommendations or search results. If you choose to promote an account you’ll be able to increase its visibility and availability to your potential customers.</p><h4 id="2-Promoted-Tweets"><a href="#2-Promoted-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="2. Promoted Tweets"></a>2. Promoted Tweets</h4><p> Any post you share on Twitter is called a tweet, and a promoted tweet is just the type of tweet a brand paid for so it can reach more people. A promoted tweet is displayed on the user’s timelines, Twitter’s mobile app or high in the search results. You can comment on, retweet or like promoted tweets, which creates a great opportunity to present the services your company offers to Twitter users who don’t follow your account. They also enable you to pick a target group and recommend the products you think they might need.</p><h4 id="3-Promoted-Trends"><a href="#3-Promoted-Trends" class="headerlink" title="3. Promoted Trends"></a>3. Promoted Trends</h4><p> A trend on Twitter is defined as a topic that is most frequently talked about at the moment. You can find the latest trending subjects in the Discover tab on your Twitter account, so using a promoted trend to advertise your brand’s products and services allows you to promote a hashtag at the very top of the Discover tab.</p><p> After someone clicks on the hashtag, they will be able to see a tweet you’re promoting as well as a list of results for the given topic. If people start using that hashtag, more Twitter users will learn about your promoted tweet and enable you to grow the number of your followers organically.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Combining several ad products is the most common method of creating an ad campaign on Twitter, although you can also use a single ad product for the same purpose. These are the types of ad campaigns most frequently used by marketers on Twitter.</p><h4 id="Tweet-Engagements"><a href="#Tweet-Engagements" class="headerlink" title="Tweet Engagements"></a>Tweet Engagements</h4><p> This a simple ad campaign that focuses on increasing the number of people talking about your brand on Twitter. You only have to pay for the first engagement with a user, while all other results of your campaign are free.</p><h4 id="Lead-Generation"><a href="#Lead-Generation" class="headerlink" title="Lead Generation"></a>Lead Generation</h4><p> This service enables you to create Lead Generation cards in Twitter’s ad manager, which contain the user’s email address and their real name as well as their username on the platform. You can download the list of possible leads from your Twitter Ads account.</p><h4 id="Clicks-and-Conversions"><a href="#Clicks-and-Conversions" class="headerlink" title="Clicks and Conversions"></a>Clicks and Conversions</h4><p> This advertising strategy is aimed at driving as much traffic to your website as possible. The service is paid on per click basis, so you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a campaign that isn’t producing results.</p><h4 id="Awareness-and-Followers"><a href="#Awareness-and-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Awareness and Followers"></a>Awareness and Followers</h4><p> If you want to increase the brand awareness, then an awareness campaign is the best solution. This type of campaign presents your profile to an audience you can’t reach and it is the only type of campaign that is based on impressions rather than on engagement rates.

This type of campaign presents your profile to an audience you can’t reach and it is the only type of campaign that is based on impressions rather than on engagement rates. Follower campaigns are aimed at increasing the follower base on your Twitter account.</p><h4 id="Fees-and-Payment-3"><a href="#Fees-and-Payment-3" class="headerlink" title="Fees and Payment"></a>Fees and Payment</h4><p> Twitter Ads enables you to choose between self-service and full service. If you choose to create your campaign independently you’ll be in charge of the entire process, while the full-service system also includes support from the platform.</p><p> In either case, you will only have to pay for the achieved results, while the rate you’ll pay for each click is determined through the auction system.</p><h2 id="How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns-3"><a href="#How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Creating a new ad campaign is a simple process that can be completed in just four steps. Here’s how you can set up your first Twitter ad campaign and start enjoying its benefits.</p><h4 id="Step-1-3"><a href="#Step-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 1"                ></p><p> Open Twitter Ads Manager. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see campaign objectives, select the ones that are most appropriate for your campaign and then click on Create Campaign button. This action will open a new window where you can give a title to your campaign or decide when you want the campaign to start.</p><h4 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-2.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 2"                ></p><p> In the next step, you will be asked to define your target audience. The platform offers a wide array of targeting options including gender, postal code or language. Twitter Ads offers support through the process, so you can maximize efficiency and reduce the costs of the campaign.</p><h4 id="Step-3-3"><a href="#Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-3.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 3"                ></p><p> Once you’ve defined the target audience as precisely as possible, you can move on to set your budget. By setting the financial limit to your campaign you can control how much you are spending on ads on a daily basis.</p><h4 id="Step-4-3"><a href="#Step-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-4.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 4"                ></p><p> At the end of the ad campaign setup, you will be asked to select a tweet you want to promote.

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011.

The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man-3"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man-3" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"

But, that utilizes the auto-share feature that automatically shares everything you post on Twitter to all your other social media. But nobody really wants to do that.</p><p>That’s why we are here to teach you to the manual method of sharing videos and how you can post a video from Twitter to Facebook. This way, you can share all your favorite tweets and videos from Twitter to Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h2><p>There are multiple ways to post your Twitter videos on your Facebook account without linking the accounts together. We have listed three ways to do that. So, let’s begin:</p><h3 id="1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h3><p>While scrolling through your Twitter feed, if you encounter a fascinating video and want to share it with your Facebook friends, then follow the steps below. The only way to share a video manually from Twitter to Facebook is by copying the link of the video.</p><p>If you have not used this method before, do not worry. We will guide you through it.</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure you have the Twitter video opened in front of you, and you have also logged into your Facebook account.</li><li>Now open the video you want to share and from the upper right corner, click on the downward-facing arrow.</li><li>This will show you three options “<strong>Copy Link To Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>Embed Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>I Don’t like this Tweet</strong>”. Select “<strong>Copy Link to Tweet</strong>”.</li><li>Now a window will open showing the link of the Tweet. You can select the link and copy it.</li><li>Next, open your Facebook page, and from the newsfeed area, <strong>Create a New Post</strong>.</li><li>Post the link of the video in the “<strong>Create a New Post Area</strong>” Once you paste the link, Facebook will find the video and load it to your post. You can preview it too before posting.</li><li>You can also type in a caption for the video and just click post to post your video.</li></ul><p>This is the easiest and most direct way to post a video from Twitter to Facebook. However, if you do not want to use the direct method for some reason, there are multiple indirect methods to post Twitter videos to Facebook.</p><h3 id="2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website"><a href="#2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website" class="headerlink" title="2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website"></a>2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website</h3><p>There are multiple sites on the internet that can help you download a Twitter video and then post it. Given below are two websites you can use to download videos. So, let’s dive in:</p><ul><li>Log into your Twitter account and open your Newsfeed on your PC.</li><li>Locate the video you want to share on Facebook. If you found the video in your newsfeed, you can look for it there.</li><li>In case you retweeted the video, you can find the video on your profile. Click on the Profile symbol, and from the dropdown menu, select Profile. Now click on the Media tab from the top of your profile and look for the video.</li><li>Once you find the video, open it and click on Play to start playing the video.</li><li>Right-click on the video next, and from the menu, select Copy Video Address. This will copy the link for the video so you can paste it wherever you want.</li><li>Now open another tab in your browser and open the <a class="link"   href="https://twdown.net/in" >TwDown <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> This website allows you to download Twitter videos and recordings easily.</li><li>Once you open the website, click on the URL textbox and paste the link you copied.</li><li>Wait for the website to find the video and load it. Once loaded, you can download it by clicking on Download Link.</li><li>This will open your video in a new tab, and you can click on the Download symbol to Download the video.</li><li>Once the video is downloaded, you can post it to Facebook.</li><li>Log into your Facebook account and open your Newsfeed. You will find the Create a New Post Text Box on the top.</li><li>Click on the Add a Video icon to add a new video.</li><li>Locate the video on your PC and click Open to add it to your post.</li><li>Now, write an appropriate caption to match your video and click on Post.</li></ul><p>And voila! You have posted a Twitter video on Facebook seamlessly.</p><h3 id="3-Download-a-Twitter-Video-with-the-sssTwitter-website-and-Post-it-on-Facebook"><a href="#3-Download-a-Twitter-Video-with-the-sssTwitter-website-and-Post-it-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="3. Download a Twitter Video with the sssTwitter website and Post it on Facebook"></a>3. Download a Twitter Video with the sssTwitter website and Post it on Facebook</h3><p>Another way to download and post a video from Twitter to Facebook is using the sssTwitter website. Here is how you can download and post the video:</p><ul><li>Now log into your Twitter account and find the video you want to share on Facebook.</li><li>Make sure you do not tap on the video and only snap the tweet to grow it.</li><li>In the URL box on top of your tab, carefully edit your URL address. Add “sss” before Twitter. For example, if it looked like “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/%5Blink" >https://twitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]” before, make sure it looks like “<a class="link"   href="https://ssstwitter.com/%5Blink" >https://ssstwitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]”</li><li>Now Press Enter.

Now, with a single click, you can post your tweets on Facebook and share your favorite videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>It can be quite a hassle to post one video on Twitter and log into your Facebook account only to post the same video so your Facebook followers can see them too.</p><p>However, social media apps have integrated to create a virtual universe that allows you to post or share a single video on multiple platforms at once.</p><p>If your accounts are connected together, you might find sharing videos across multiple platforms relatively easy. But, that utilizes the auto-share feature that automatically shares everything you post on Twitter to all your other social media. But nobody really wants to do that.</p><p>That’s why we are here to teach you to the manual method of sharing videos and how you can post a video from Twitter to Facebook. This way, you can share all your favorite tweets and videos from Twitter to Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h2><p>There are multiple ways to post your Twitter videos on your Facebook account without linking the accounts together. We have listed three ways to do that. So, let’s begin:</p><h3 id="1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#1-Using-the-Direct-Method-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook"></a>1. Using the Direct Method to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook</h3><p>While scrolling through your Twitter feed, if you encounter a fascinating video and want to share it with your Facebook friends, then follow the steps below. The only way to share a video manually from Twitter to Facebook is by copying the link of the video.</p><p>If you have not used this method before, do not worry. We will guide you through it.</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure you have the Twitter video opened in front of you, and you have also logged into your Facebook account.</li><li>Now open the video you want to share and from the upper right corner, click on the downward-facing arrow.</li><li>This will show you three options “<strong>Copy Link To Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>Embed Tweet</strong>”, “<strong>I Don’t like this Tweet</strong>”. Select “<strong>Copy Link to Tweet</strong>”.</li><li>Now a window will open showing the link of the Tweet. You can select the link and copy it.</li><li>Next, open your Facebook page, and from the newsfeed area, <strong>Create a New Post</strong>.</li><li>Post the link of the video in the “<strong>Create a New Post Area</strong>” Once you paste the link, Facebook will find the video and load it to your post. You can preview it too before posting.</li><li>You can also type in a caption for the video and just click post to post your video.</li></ul><p>This is the easiest and most direct way to post a video from Twitter to Facebook. However, if you do not want to use the direct method for some reason, there are multiple indirect methods to post Twitter videos to Facebook.</p><h3 id="2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website-3"><a href="#2-Downloading-and-Posting-Videos-Using-TwDown-Website-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website"></a>2. Downloading and Posting Videos Using TwDown Website</h3><p>There are multiple sites on the internet that can help you download a Twitter video and then post it. Given below are two websites you can use to download videos. So, let’s dive in:</p><ul><li>Log into your Twitter account and open your Newsfeed on your PC.</li><li>Locate the video you want to share on Facebook. If you found the video in your newsfeed, you can look for it there.</li><li>In case you retweeted the video, you can find the video on your profile. Click on the Profile symbol, and from the dropdown menu, select Profile. Now click on the Media tab from the top of your profile and look for the video.</li><li>Once you find the video, open it and click on Play to start playing the video.</li><li>Right-click on the video next, and from the menu, select Copy Video Address. This will copy the link for the video so you can paste it wherever you want.</li><li>Now open another tab in your browser and open the <a class="link"   href="https://twdown.net/in" >TwDown <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> This website allows you to download Twitter videos and recordings easily.</li><li>Once you open the website, click on the URL textbox and paste the link you copied.</li><li>Wait for the website to find the video and load it. Once loaded, you can download it by clicking on Download Link.</li><li>This will open your video in a new tab, and you can click on the Download symbol to Download the video.</li><li>Once the video is downloaded, you can post it to Facebook.</li><li>Log into your Facebook account and open your Newsfeed. You will find the Create a New Post Text Box on the top.</li><li>Click on the Add a Video icon to add a new video.</li><li>Locate the video on your PC and click Open to add it to your post.</li><li>Now, write an appropriate caption to match your video and click on Post.</li></ul><p>And voila! You have posted a Twitter video on Facebook seamlessly.</p><h3 id="3-Download-a-Twitter-Video-with-the-sssTwitter-website-and-Post-it-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#3-Download-a-Twitter-Video-with-the-sssTwitter-website-and-Post-it-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Here is how you can download and post the video:</p><ul><li>Now log into your Twitter account and find the video you want to share on Facebook.</li><li>Make sure you do not tap on the video and only snap the tweet to grow it.</li><li>In the URL box on top of your tab, carefully edit your URL address. Add “sss” before Twitter. For example, if it looked like “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/%5Blink" >https://twitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]” before, make sure it looks like “<a class="link"   href="https://ssstwitter.com/%5Blink" >https://ssstwitter.com/[link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>]”</li><li>Now Press Enter.

There are over 500 million tweets shared every day!</p><p>Whether you want to have a funny banter with your followers, follow your favorite celebrity or keep up with the latest global news, Twitter is the best option. You can find a vast pool of content on Twitter, including one-line tweets to threads, pictures, gifs, and videos.</p><p>However, many users often complain about no sound on Twitter videos. If your Twitter videos have no sound, it also leads to a bad user experience.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss the reasons why is there no sound on Twitter videos and the best solution to fix this issue.</p><p>So, let’s begin!</p><h2 id="Why-Is-There-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos"><a href="#Why-Is-There-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Is There No Sound on Twitter Videos?"></a>Why Is There No Sound on Twitter Videos?</h2><p>There are many reasons for no sound on uploaded twitter videos. The issue could be with your device, browser, or the Twitter app itself.</p><p>Here are all the possible reasons why there is no sound on Twitter videos.</p><h3 id="1-Problem-with-the-App"><a href="#1-Problem-with-the-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Problem with the App"></a>1. Problem with the App</h3><p>There could be a problem with Twitter video sound because of an in-app issue. For example, you have an outdated version of the app, or the app cache is full. Things like that can often create issues and hinder the app’s functionality.</p><h3 id="2-Network-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Network-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Network Connectivity"></a>2. Network Connectivity</h3><p>A weak network connection can also be a common cause of no sound or poor video quality. With a weak or faulty connection, you will see a loading symbol on the video&#x2F;audio file that never seems to end – something painstakingly annoying!</p><p>A strong internet connection will avoid Twitter videos’ improper functionality and smoothly load the file’s contents.</p><h3 id="3-Old-Browsers"><a href="#3-Old-Browsers" class="headerlink" title="3. Old Browsers"></a>3. Old Browsers</h3><p>An old browser lags and does not load files properly. Thus, it can be a reason for no audio on the Twitter videos. Either update the browser or switch to a new browser altogether.</p><h3 id="4-The-Twitter-Cache"><a href="#4-The-Twitter-Cache" class="headerlink" title="4. The Twitter Cache"></a>4. The Twitter Cache</h3><p>The browser cookies or cache and Twitter application cache can also cause Twitter video sound problems. When the cache is full, the app or browser will not perform to its optimal potential.</p><h3 id="5-System-Software-Updates"><a href="#5-System-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="5. System Software Updates"></a>5. System Software Updates</h3><p>Your device could also cause no sound on the Twitter video. When you don’t update the operating system software of your PC&#x2F;Phone, it can cause errors in the device and lead to functionality issues. Moreover, the Twitter app might also not be compatible with an outdated system.</p><h3 id="6-Device-Storage"><a href="#6-Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="6. Device Storage"></a>6. Device Storage</h3><p>When the device memory is full, it can lead to formatting issues, causing no sound on Twitter videos.</p><h3 id="7-Video-Format"><a href="#7-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="7. Video Format"></a>7. Video Format</h3><p>An incompatible video format uploaded on Twitter will also have no sound. Sometimes, there is nothing you can do about it if the video format is incorrect. It will show all kinds of errors, including no sound.</p><h2 id="How-to-Fix-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos-on-Chrome"><a href="#How-to-Fix-No-Sound-on-Twitter-Videos-on-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix No Sound on Twitter Videos on Chrome?"></a>How to Fix No Sound on Twitter Videos on Chrome?</h2><p>Sometimes no sound on Twitter videos could be due to a browser-related issue. Let’s talk about all the possible methods to fix no sound on Twitter videos on Chrome:</p><h3 id="1-Enable-Flash"><a href="#1-Enable-Flash" class="headerlink" title="1. Enable Flash"></a>1. Enable Flash</h3><p>If Chrome flash is disabled, then your videos will not play on Chrome. Click on the lock shape icon on the address bar, and make sure flash is not blocked.</p><p>If flash is disabled and outdated, install the updated version.</p><p>![Check for flash player and updates](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why-" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why- <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is-there-no-sound-on-twitter- videos-1.jpg)</p><h3 id="2-Clear-Cookies-and-Cache"><a href="#2-Clear-Cookies-and-Cache" class="headerlink" title="2. Clear Cookies and Cache"></a>2. Clear Cookies and Cache</h3><p>Sounds too simple right? But you’d be surprised to know that 99% of browser-related problems are fixed once you clear cookies and cache.</p><p>To clear cookies and cache:</p><ul><li>Go to Chrome Settings by clicking on the three vertical dots in the top right corner of the browser.</li><li>Search for Cookie and select ‘clear browsing data’ under Security and privacy.</li><li>Select ‘Cookies and other site data’ and ‘cached images and files’ and click on Clear Data.</li></ul><p>![Clear cache for smooth browser experience](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why-" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why- <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is-there-no-sound-on-twitter- videos-2.jpg)</p><p>Hopefully, this will resolve the issue of no Twitter video sound on the Chrome browser.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-Chrome-Plugins-Extensions"><a href="#3-Disable-Chrome-Plugins-Extensions" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable Chrome Plugins&#x2F;Extensions"></a>3. Disable Chrome Plugins&#x2F;Extensions</h3><p>If none of the steps above have worked so far and your Twitter videos are playing in other browsers except for Chrome, try managing your extensions.</p><p>For this, you have to disable Chrome extensions and reload to check if the Twitter video plays audio.</p><p>Here is how you can do this:</p><ul><li>Click on the three dots on the top right corner of the address bar and select More Tools &gt; “Extensions.”</li><li>Your Chrome extensions will be listed so you can easily manage them one by one.</li></ul><p>You can also do this:</p><ul><li>Type <strong>chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;extensions</strong> in the search bar and hit Enter.</li><li>Turn off all the plugins, particularly the advertisement blockers.</li><li>Now close the browser and launch again.</li></ul><p>![Disable plug-ins and extensions](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why-" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why- <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is-there-no-sound-on-twitter- videos-3.jpg)</p><p>This should resolve the issue and play sound on Twitter videos in Chrome.</p><h3 id="4-Disable-Hardware-Acceleration"><a href="#4-Disable-Hardware-Acceleration" class="headerlink" title="4.
