* Tap “Profile” to see your profile details at the time you requested the archive file. This would comprise all the followers and the followings that the account would have at the download request.
* Tap “Contacts” to check the list of contacts to whom you have uploaded across Twitter from the phone or the device that you’ve connected with the platform.
* Tap “Connected Applications” to see all the applications you have given access to to access data from Twitter.
* Tap “Sessions” to check the apps that have accessed your account at different instances.
