### 2\. Watch Twitter Videos in HD on IOS App

You can also download the Twitter app on your iOS device, i.e., iPod, iPad, or iPhone, and **watch high-quality videos on Twitter.** You need to follow the following steps to use Twitter for iOS:

**Step 1: Download** the Twitter for iOS app if you have not installed it on your Apple device yet.

**Note:** You can download it from the Apple Store instead of the Play Store that is present in Android devices. If you have already installed it on your device, you can update it.

**Step 2: Log in** with an existing account or **Sign up** for a new account to use this application after the completion of its installation.

**Note:** Once the application has been installed, you can use the application using your email and entering your password. You can also manage multiple accounts through your app.

**Step 4:** Select **Video Autoplay** to play the videos automatically when they appear on your screen.

**Step 5:** Select **Settings** and tap on **Video Tweets** in the account section to watch HD videos of different types.

## Reasons Why Twitter HD Videos Not Playing

Sometimes, Twitter HD videos stop playing in the mobile application or in your browser. The reasons behind this happening have been enlisted below:

**Network Issue**

The issue of network connection is the major issue behind the improper functionality of the Twitter app. When the internet connection is slow, Twitter does not let you watch HD videos because they are high in quality and require fast speed internet connection.

You should also check the signal strength of your network from the connectivity settings. You can also switch towards another network that has strong signal strengths.

**Cache and Cookies of the Browser**

Twitter HD videos may not be played because of the cache data and cookies in your browser. You need to clear the cache of your application by clicking on Settings < Appa < Twitter < Clear Cache. You can also delete it from the browser if you are using Twitter on Chrome.

**Plugins’ Security Software**

Sometimes, the plugins’ security software and firewall options can hinder Twitter HD videos not to playing accurately and efficiently.
