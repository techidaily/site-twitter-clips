 It’s hard to explain why but renaming the Diablo Immortal folder is a simple trick that helped many users to run the game properly. To do this, follow the steps:

1. Navigate to the**game’s installation folder** . Generally you can find it at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Battlenet.
2. Rename the**Diablo Immortal folder** to Diablo Immortal1 or whatever you like.
3. Open the**Diablo Immortal Launcher** directly from the folder.

### Fix 4 – Update your graphics driver

 The graphics card driver is very essential for gaming performance. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you may suffer from various performance issues of Diablo Immortal including game crashes, low FPS and stuttering. And you should update the graphics driver for maximum gameplay.

 Major GPU manufacturers frequently release new graphics drivers which will give performance improvements, particularly for newer games. Simply go to their official websites ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) ), find the driver corresponding with your operating system and download it manually.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers on your own, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct GPU drivers for your Windows version. And it only takes two steps:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/de-5.7.2-scan-1.jpg)  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/amd-6800xt.jpg)

 When the update finishes, reboot your computer for the changes to take effect. The game should be running more smoothly with better performance. If not, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 5 – Scan and repair game files

 Verifying the game files is a common workaround for you to resolve random crashes or failed installations. If there’s something wrong with the game files, you can have them repaired following the instruction below.

1. Open the**Battle.net launcher** .
2. Select**Diablo Immortal** from the game list. Then click the**gear icon** beside the Play button and click**Scan and Repair** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/scan-game-files.jpg)
3. Click**Begin Scan** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/scan-game-files-2-1.jpg)

 The scanning will start immediately, followed by a repair update if missing or corrupt files are found. Once done, restart the game and see how it works. Still no luck? There is one more fix to try.

### Fix 6 – Disable Discord overlay

 The Discord overlay may also cause a game to malfunction. You could just turn it off and see if Diablo Immortal stops crashing.

1. Open Discord.
2. Click the**gear icon** in the lower-left corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-2-1-1.jpg)
3. Select**Game Overlay** from the left pane and**toggle off** the button for**Enable in-game overlay** .
