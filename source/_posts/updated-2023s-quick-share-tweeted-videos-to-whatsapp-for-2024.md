## Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link

Well, you learned all the steps revolving around how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not have Twitter? Then what?

There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else. Still, you cannot embed it with the link.

There is an easy way to counter this problem if you wish to share Twitter Videos on WhatsApp directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on WhatsApp without any link. Just follow the steps below, and you will be all set.
