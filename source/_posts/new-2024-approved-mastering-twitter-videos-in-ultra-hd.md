**Update Twitter App**

Sometimes, HD videos cannot be played on Twitter if you have not installed the latest version of Twitter on your iPhone or Android device. So, you need to go to Apple Store or Play Store to download the latest version of Twitter or update the existing one. After updating, you can play the HD videos efficiently in the Twitter app.

**Launch Mobile Browser**

If you find out that Twitter HD video is not playing on Android or iPhone, you should try cleaning some data from your phone. You should make some storage space in your mobile phone and should also clean some cache data from your phone’s browser.
