Do not include an overly crowded photo or out-of-context things; it will take away the essence of your context. You can add simple graphics or photos and text that best describes your video's primary purpose or topic.

Overdoing anything kills its purpose and appeal. It should be catchy but do not cram too much information into the thumbnail.

### Tip no 3: Visible text
