Watching videos is something that everyone enjoys. Videos are chosen by a significant majority of people on all social media platforms. But why is this the case?

Consumers favor videos because they are simple to consume, grasp, and comprehend. In contrast, video producers prefer videos because they know that their content is available to everyone with an internet connection.

Twitter also keeps up with the times. In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a 'renowned' Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.

To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 **Most Viewed Videos on Twitter**. Let's dive in.

## What is 'Most Viewed?'

Even though this is hardly rocket science for many, some people continue to conflate the terms' most watched' and 'viral.' So, what is it that distinguishes the worlds of the two? It's as easy as the number of views!

When a video is deemed the 'most viewed,' it means that it is currently leading the pack in terms of the number of people who have seen it compared to all other videos on the platform.

## 10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter

### 1\. **Messi's Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz**

This is the most viewed twitter video of 2022\. This video's caption says, "Lionel still needs to explain how he did this." This video was posted on January 25, 2022, with around 4.7M views in just two days. This video features Filipe Luiz of Atletico de Madrid getting nutmegged by Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona. Nutmeg is the term used when a ball goes through the legs of the player. It is considered one of the most humiliating things in football for an opponent player.

Lionel Messi, an Argentinian International, is regarded as one of the best players the footballing world has ever seen. He is a seven times Ballon D'or and a six times FIFA THE BEST award winner. Messi was an integral part of FC Barcelona's glory period.

Now, getting back to the video, in the video, Messi is seen nutmegging the Atletico de Madrid's left-back by the body faint, which was never seen before in football history.

### 2\. ****A Metaverse Prison Yard Virtual Video By Elon Musk**

Still, for those who don't know the man, Elon Musk is a flamboyant entrepreneur best known as the co-founder of PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA) and the creator of SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, among other ventures. He happens to have tweeted one of the most viewed Twitter videos in 2022.

### 3\. ****Falcon 9's Landing by SpaceX**

SpaceX's Falcon 9 medium-lift launch system is a partly reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift spacecraft developed and constructed in the United States. The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.

As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.

And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9's first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.

Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.

### 4\. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer

The caption of this twitter video reads, "this season on #EUPHORIA…". This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.

Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.

This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song 'Call Me Irresponsible,' until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya's voiceover tells: "Everything seems so definite when you're younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away." This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.

### 5\. ****Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates**

Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy. On December 9, 2021, he tweeted a video that only lasts 58 seconds but has received more than 2M views as the world prepares to enter 2022.

Bill said, I remain hopeful about the prospects for accelerated innovation in the climate field. I'm hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again."

Isn't it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.

This video is basically about Neymar dribbling in the opposition's half for fun. Neymar is regarded as one of the best dribblers of this generation of football players.

### 9\. ****'AVE IT!’ by LADbible**

Are you ready to see some of the most popular humorous videos on the internet? Although we didn't intend to include the "fun" genre on our list, we couldn't help but include this one since we did not want to let this one slip between the cracks.

We think it's pretty amusing. That might not be the case for you if you were in the position of the bald man who had his face smacked with the ball kicked by the small youngster standing next to him. While this may sound hazardous or unpleasant, we promise you will have a good chuckle and come away with a different point of view after watching it.

The video was shared on Twitter today by the LADbible's account, and it seems to have been seen by as many as 1 million people thus far. That was lightning-fast. And you can pretty much guarantee that this video will continue to gain popularity and get another couple of million views in no time!

### 3\. ****Falcon 9's Landing by SpaceX**

SpaceX's Falcon 9 medium-lift launch system is a partly reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift spacecraft developed and constructed in the United States. The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.

As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.

And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9's first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.

Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.

### 4\. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer

The caption of this twitter video reads, "this season on #EUPHORIA…". This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.

Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.

This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song 'Call Me Irresponsible,' until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya's voiceover tells: "Everything seems so definite when you're younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away." This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.

### 5\. ****Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates**

Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy. On December 9, 2021, he tweeted a video that only lasts 58 seconds but has received more than 2M views as the world prepares to enter 2022.

Bill said, I remain hopeful about the prospects for accelerated innovation in the climate field. I'm hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again."

Isn't it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.

### 9\. ****'AVE IT!’ by LADbible**

Are you ready to see some of the most popular humorous videos on the internet? Although we didn't intend to include the "fun" genre on our list, we couldn't help but include this one since we did not want to let this one slip between the cracks.

We think it's pretty amusing. That might not be the case for you if you were in the position of the bald man who had his face smacked with the ball kicked by the small youngster standing next to him. While this may sound hazardous or unpleasant, we promise you will have a good chuckle and come away with a different point of view after watching it.

The video was shared on Twitter today by the LADbible's account, and it seems to have been seen by as many as 1 million people thus far. That was lightning-fast. And you can pretty much guarantee that this video will continue to gain popularity and get another couple of million views in no time!

## Conclusion

As we mentioned earlier, watching videos is fun. Everyone loves them. They help you understand the context in a much more comprehensive way than, perhaps, say, a picture. We hope you liked our content on the **Most Viewed Twitter Video**. We did our best to include the ones that were viewed the most. However, if we missed out on some, let us know in the comment section to have more discussion about it.

Watching videos is something that everyone enjoys. Videos are chosen by a significant majority of people on all social media platforms. But why is this the case?

Consumers favor videos because they are simple to consume, grasp, and comprehend. In contrast, video producers prefer videos because they know that their content is available to everyone with an internet connection.

Twitter also keeps up with the times. In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a 'renowned' Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.

To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 **Most Viewed Videos on Twitter**. Let's dive in.

## What is 'Most Viewed?'

Even though this is hardly rocket science for many, some people continue to conflate the terms' most watched' and 'viral.' So, what is it that distinguishes the worlds of the two? It's as easy as the number of views!

When a video is deemed the 'most viewed,' it means that it is currently leading the pack in terms of the number of people who have seen it compared to all other videos on the platform.

### 3\. ****Falcon 9's Landing by SpaceX**

SpaceX's Falcon 9 medium-lift launch system is a partly reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift spacecraft developed and constructed in the United States. The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.

As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.

And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9's first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.

Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.

### 4\. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer

The caption of this twitter video reads, "this season on #EUPHORIA…". This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.

Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.

This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song 'Call Me Irresponsible,' until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya's voiceover tells: "Everything seems so definite when you're younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away." This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.

### 5\. ****Looking Into 2022 From Bill Gates**

Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft and someone who seems to be quite wealthy. On December 9, 2021, he tweeted a video that only lasts 58 seconds but has received more than 2M views as the world prepares to enter 2022.

Bill said, I remain hopeful about the prospects for accelerated innovation in the climate field. I'm hopeful about the work of global health, which is building on some of the pandemic advances that have already been implemented. I believe that the year 2022 will mark the beginning of the transition to a new normal for many of us. As a result, I believe we will build on the new material. It seems that we have a lot of chances, and I am optimistic that we will take the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic like this from occurring again."

Isn't it amazing that these words of encouragement and inspiration come directly from the guy himself? Yes, without a doubt! Even though we all know how the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on how we live our lives today, these statements from Bill Gates seem to have encouraged many people to think more optimistically forward the new year of 2022.

### 6\. **Neymar's Dribbling**

The title of this Twitter video is "Just Neymar." It is posted from the official Twitter account of the UEFA Champions League, which is considered the biggest club football tournament in Europe. The video was posted on January 25, 2022, and gathered around 1.6M views in just 24 hours.

On February 5, 1992, he was born in Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil, as Neymar. Neymar is widely considered one of the most talented players of his time.

The flexible attacker is most effective on the left-wing, although he can also play on the right side and as an attacker or second striker. The Brazilian has 202 club goals in 346 matches and 53 international goals in 83 outings.

This video is basically about Neymar dribbling in the opposition's half for fun. Neymar is regarded as one of the best dribblers of this generation of football players.

### 9\. ****'AVE IT!’ by LADbible**

Are you ready to see some of the most popular humorous videos on the internet? Although we didn't intend to include the "fun" genre on our list, we couldn't help but include this one since we did not want to let this one slip between the cracks.

We think it's pretty amusing. That might not be the case for you if you were in the position of the bald man who had his face smacked with the ball kicked by the small youngster standing next to him. While this may sound hazardous or unpleasant, we promise you will have a good chuckle and come away with a different point of view after watching it.

The video was shared on Twitter today by the LADbible's account, and it seems to have been seen by as many as 1 million people thus far. That was lightning-fast. And you can pretty much guarantee that this video will continue to gain popularity and get another couple of million views in no time!

### 10\. **Ronaldo Playing Football with A Boy Without Legs**

This video was posted by the official Twitter account of The Sun Magazine, which is a well-known based in North Carolina. It was uploaded on January 25, 2022, with around 894K views.

Cristiano Ronaldo, a Portuguese International and Manchester United (England) footballer, is considered one of the greatest footballers ever. He has previously played for Sporting Club de Portugal (Portugal), Real Madrid (Spain), and Juventus (Italy). Ronaldo also has the most international goals in the history of football. He is a six-time Ballon D'or and FIFA THE BEST award winner five times. He is undoubtedly the deadliest striker of this generation.

## Conclusion

As we mentioned earlier, watching videos is fun. Everyone loves them. They help you understand the context in a much more comprehensive way than, perhaps, say, a picture. We hope you liked our content on the **Most Viewed Twitter Video**. We did our best to include the ones that were viewed the most.

Watching videos is something that everyone enjoys. Videos are chosen by a significant majority of people on all social media platforms. But why is this the case?

Consumers favor videos because they are simple to consume, grasp, and comprehend. In contrast, video producers prefer videos because they know that their content is available to everyone with an internet connection.

Twitter also keeps up with the times. In fact, we frequently come across videos of incredible quality that have received millions of views. While such videos may not have been broadcast from a 'renowned' Twitter account with thousands or millions of followers, they nonetheless manage to get a large number of views due to the high quality of their material.

To avoid delving too deeply into the whys and hows, it is now time to turn our focus toward what brought us to this page in the first place: the top 10 **Most Viewed Videos on Twitter**. Let's dive in.

## What is 'Most Viewed?'

Even though this is hardly rocket science for many, some people continue to conflate the terms' most watched' and 'viral.' So, what is it that distinguishes the worlds of the two? It's as easy as the number of views!

When a video is deemed the 'most viewed,' it means that it is currently leading the pack in terms of the number of people who have seen it compared to all other videos on the platform.

## 10 Most Viewed Videos on Twitter

### 1\. **Messi's Astonishing Nutmeg on Filipe Luiz**

### 3\. ****Falcon 9's Landing by SpaceX**

SpaceX's Falcon 9 medium-lift launch system is a partly reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift spacecraft developed and constructed in the United States. The most recent version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown several times.

As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has completed the most significant number of launches of any United States launchers currently operational. It is also the only U.S. rocket completely accredited for human spaceflight to the International Space Station and the only infomercial rocket capable of launching humans into orbit.

And this is precisely what the video is about. It shows the Falcon 9's first stage that has landed on Landing Zone 1 after completing its tour in the outer world – commonly known as Space Station.

Talking about the video metrics, the videos gathered around 3M views which is a decent return considering it was only posted 13 days ago. You can watch the video for further information about how one of the influential rocket machines landed back on the planet successfully after its objective.

### 4\. Euphoria Season 2 Trailer

The caption of this twitter video reads, "this season on #EUPHORIA…". This video was posted from the official Twitter account of Euphoria on January 10, 2022 and has around 2.3M views to date. Euphoria is a TV series from HBO which features Zendaya as Rue Bennett.

Euphoria follows the lives of modern teenagers as they deal with issues of identification, narcotics, sex, tragedy, and friendship. While the series is recognized for its shocking imagery, outstanding cinematography, and signature look, many viewers have questioned where it takes place.

This video is a trailer for their upcoming season. The trailer alone provided us a taste of what to anticipate, with Rue blissfully singing away to the iconic song 'Call Me Irresponsible,' until things take a tragic twist as Zendaya's voiceover tells: "Everything seems so definite when you're younger. But as you get old, you understand that nothing is. And everyone you care about may fade away." This video has made the fans even more curious, and they are eagerly waiting for season 2 to drop.

### 9\. ****'AVE IT!’ by LADbible**

Are you ready to see some of the most popular humorous videos on the internet? Although we didn't intend to include the "fun" genre on our list, we couldn't help but include this one since we did not want to let this one slip between the cracks.

We think it's pretty amusing. That might not be the case for you if you were in the position of the bald man who had his face smacked with the ball kicked by the small youngster standing next to him. While this may sound hazardous or unpleasant, we promise you will have a good chuckle and come away with a different point of view after watching it.

The video was shared on Twitter today by the LADbible's account, and it seems to have been seen by as many as 1 million people thus far. That was lightning-fast. And you can pretty much guarantee that this video will continue to gain popularity and get another couple of million views in no time!

### 10\. **Ronaldo Playing Football with A Boy Without Legs**

This caption of this Twitter video reads, "Cristiano Ronaldo is showing his caring side by playing football with a boy who is born without legs." This video was posted by the official Twitter account of The Sun Magazine, which is a well-known based in North Carolina. It was uploaded on January 25, 2022, with around 894K views.

Cristiano Ronaldo, a Portuguese International and Manchester United (England) footballer, is considered one of the greatest footballers ever. He has previously played for Sporting Club de Portugal (Portugal), Real Madrid (Spain), and Juventus (Italy). Ronaldo also has the most international goals in the history of football. He is a six-time Ballon D'or and FIFA THE BEST award winner five times. He is undoubtedly the deadliest striker of this generation.

Even after achieving the great bound of success, he is humble and understands the emotions of his fans, and this video is the perfect example of that humbleness.
