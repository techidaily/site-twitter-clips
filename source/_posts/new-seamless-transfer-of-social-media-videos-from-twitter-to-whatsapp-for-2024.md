## Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link

Well, you learned all the steps revolving around how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not have Twitter? Then what?

There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else. Still, you cannot embed it with the link.

There is an easy way to counter this problem if you wish to share Twitter Videos on WhatsApp directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on WhatsApp without any link. Just follow the steps below, and you will be all set.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Log in to your Twitter using your credentials.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Head to your internet browser and type in ‘pastedownload.com.' It is an online tool that helps you save videos offline using their link only. You can easily share the videos.

![Open the website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-10.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Step 2: Paste the Link

Copy and paste the link of the Twitter video you want to share in the dialogue box of the website. Once the link is pasted, it will automatically start the process and convert the video in a matter of seconds. The video will be ready to download.

![Paste the link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-11.jpg)

![Video is being downloaded](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-12.jpg)

## Step 3: Download the Video in the Desired Format

As soon as the conversion is completed, the website will show you the video preview and different options of sizes and video quality options to choose from. Various quality options are available, including 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality. The size of the download file varies with the quality. The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter.

![Different file sizes and quantities](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-13.jpg)

Choose the file size and quality that matches your requirements and click download. The file will download into your device's internal storage, and now you can easily share it.

## Step 4: Share it on WhatsApp

Now that the file is downloaded, all you have to do is open up WhatsApp, navigate to the chat of the person or group you wish to send the video to, and attach the video from the in-app file manager, or you can share it directly from your gallery.

![Share on Whatsapp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-14.jpg)
