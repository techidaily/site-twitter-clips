The use of social media platforms is limited to sharing posts online but messaging, sending timed pictures, text messages, videos, and sharing all sorts of content is also a part of it. People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.

All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.

## How to Share Videos on Snapchat

The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.

## Record and Send

You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.

After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a 'Your Story' option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.

## Upload from Camera Roll

Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device's storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.

Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.

## How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link

People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features. If you wish to share a Twitter video with a link on Snapchat, follow these steps to learn how to do it most efficiently.

Tap the share icon.

## Step 3: Download the Video in the Desired Format

As soon as the conversion is completed, the website will show you the video preview and different options of sizes and video quality to choose from. There are various quality options available that include 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality, and the size of the download file varies with the quality.

The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter. Choose the file size and quality that matches your requirements and click download. The file will download into your device's internal storage, and now you can easily share it on Snapchat.
