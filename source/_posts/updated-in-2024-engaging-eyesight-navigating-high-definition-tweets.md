## How To Fix Twitter HD Videos Not Playing on Chrome?

There are several reasons behind this happening. You need to consider the following things if HD videos are not being played on Chrome:

### Format not Compatible

This situation may occur when the video format supported by Twitter is different from the video format supported by the browser. When you notice that all the videos on your device are being played instead of any one of them, it means the video format is not compatible with your device. In this condition, you need to copy the link and download it to watch it.

### Browser’s Flash

When you notice that a Twitter HD video is being played on your mobile but not on your Chrome, you need to check Chrome Settings. The reason behind this happening might be that the browser’s flash is not enabled. For checking it, you should click on the lock shape icon on the address bar and make sure that the flash is not blocked.
