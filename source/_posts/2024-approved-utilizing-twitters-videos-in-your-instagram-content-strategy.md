## Share Twitter Video on Instagram Story

Instagram is a relatively more visual platform compared to Twitter, with an array of pictures and videos everywhere. This makes Instagram also more photo and video-friendly.

Now that you are familiar with all the benefits of cross-posting Twitter videos to Instagram, you can learn how to do that in quick and easy steps.

Instagram stories are also a very interactive feature that allow you to post content that will stay on your profile for just 24 hours and then get deleted automatically. You can post your Twitter video on Instagram stories if you don’t want to post the video permanently on your profile. Here is how you can post Twitter videos on Instagram stories:

### 1\. Share Twitter Videos on Instagram Story Chrome

While you always have the option of posting the Twitter video link on your Instagram story, this is not the same as posting as video. The link will lead them back to Twitter to watch the video, and people rarely open links to watch something. This means that you might have to post the actual video on your stories, and here is how you can do that.

If you are using chrome and your PC to access Twitter and Instagram, then open your browser.

* Open Twitter and login with your credentials.
* Locate the video from your Newsfeed. If you have retweeted the video, then you can find it under the media tab of your Profile.

## Share Twitter Video on Instagram Story

Instagram is a relatively more visual platform compared to Twitter, with an array of pictures and videos everywhere. This makes Instagram also more photo and video-friendly.

Now that you are familiar with all the benefits of cross-posting Twitter videos to Instagram, you can learn how to do that in quick and easy steps.

Instagram stories are also a very interactive feature that allow you to post content that will stay on your profile for just 24 hours and then get deleted automatically. You can post your Twitter video on Instagram stories if you don’t want to post the video permanently on your profile. Here is how you can post Twitter videos on Instagram stories:

### 1\. Share Twitter Videos on Instagram Story Chrome

While you always have the option of posting the Twitter video link on your Instagram story, this is not the same as posting as video. The link will lead them back to Twitter to watch the video, and people rarely open links to watch something. This means that you might have to post the actual video on your stories, and here is how you can do that.

If you are using chrome and your PC to access Twitter and Instagram, then open your browser.

* Open Twitter and login with your credentials.
* Locate the video from your Newsfeed. If you have retweeted the video, then you can find it under the media tab of your Profile.

![twitter videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-video-on-instagram-1.png)

* Once you locate the video, right-click on the video, and from the menu, select “Copy Video Address”. This will copy the video URL to the PC’s clipboard.
* You need to download the video with a video downloading website like [Twitter Video Downloader](https://twittervideodownloader.com/).
* Open Twitter video Downloader in a New Tab.
* Now, paste the copied video URL into the URL box on the top of the screen.

![twitter videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-video-on-instagram-2.png)

* Then click Download. This will allow the website to locate the video and convert it.
* You can set your output format to mp4 and click on Download to download the video to your device.
* Once you have downloaded the video, the next step is uploading it. Log into your Instagram in another tab.
* Now to view your Instagram in mobile mode from your PC, click on the three dots just under the close button for chrome. This will open the view menu.
* From the view menu, select More Tools and then click on Developer tools. You can also use the shortcut: **Crtl+ Shift + J**for Windows and **Command+ Options+J** for Mac.
* Once the Developer Tools window opens, you will see two little icons on the top right. One of these features a small mobile symbol, and the other is designed like a tablet. As you hover the cursor over it, it will read the Toggle device bar. Click on it.

![twitter videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-video-on-instagram-3.png)

* Once you click on it, you will see that now your browser looks like a mobile screen. Now click on the little icon at the bottom of the screen in a little “+” sign beside the magnifying glass icon. This icon will allow you to create a new post or story.
* Tap on the “Story” option from the bottom of the screen to create a new Instagram story.
* Now select the video you want to post. You can add captions, stickers, or emojis to add some glamor.
