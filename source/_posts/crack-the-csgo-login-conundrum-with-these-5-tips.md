## Fix 7: Repair missing or corrupted system files

 If all else fails, it’s time to check if you have missing or corrupted system files. System files are important components that allow Windows and programs like Minecraft to function properly. Over time, these files can become damaged or go missing, which can lead to problems like having no audio in Minecraft.

 Performing a system scan and repairing any issues it finds is an important troubleshooting step when dealing with the no-sound problem in Minecraft. A system scan will check for any corrupted, damaged, or missing files and components and attempt to restore or fix them. This helps ensure that Windows and programs have all the files they need to work correctly.

To perform a system scan and repair on Windows:

### Use the SFC tool

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows Logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/windows-logo.png) , type in**command prompt** , and select **Run as administrator.** (If Windows prompts for permission, click **OK** to continue.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-command-prompt-admin-1.jpg)
2. Type in **SFC /Scannow** , and then press **Enter** .  

![win 11 command prompt to run sfc 1](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-command-prompt-run-sfc-1.jpg)
3. It’ll take some time for the SFC to repair the corrupted system files if it detects any.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-command-prompt-run-sfc-3.png)
4. When the process is completed, reboot your computer and test Minecraft again to see if sound is restored.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Utilize Fortect – a dedicated repair tool

 While sfc can detect and restore some corrupted system files, it is limited in scope. sfc only scans protected Windows system files and cannot repair other issues outside the core OS. It also cannot optimize the system by cleaning junk files or defragmenting the registry.

 In contrast, **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  provides a more comprehensive scan that looks at the entire system, while also offering automatic repairs for a wider range of problems.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-1.jpg)
3. Fortect will scan your computer thoroughly. This may take a few minutes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)
4. Once done, you’ll see a detailed report of all the issues on your PC. To fix them automatically, click**START REPAIR** . This requires you to purchase the full version. But don’t worry. If Fortect doesn’t solve the issue, you can request a refund within 60 days.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-3.jpg)

 The full version of Fortect comes with a**60-day money-back guarantee** . If you are not satisfied with it or you don’t need it anymore, contact their support team at[support@fortect.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
