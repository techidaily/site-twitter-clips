### Recover your Data

If you have deleted any important post or picture on your Twitter, you don’t need to worry. All the data that you have shared across Twitter is recoverable. Through the Twitter archive, you can easily retrieve the lost post and save it permanently on your computer.

## Part 2: How to Request Twitter Archive?

Once you are aware of why the Twitter archive is considered to be used across an account, it is now time to understand the process of obtaining one. This part will guide you with the ultimate steps to request a Twitter archive manually. Just follow our below guidelines:

**Step 1:** Firstly, sign in to your Twitter account by entering your name and password. Once open, click on “More” from the left side menu. Now tap on "Settings and Privacy," which will open another menu. From there, click on "Your Account."

**Step 2:** In the menu of your account, click on "Download an archive of your data." After clicking on it, Twitter will ask you your password. If you have enabled two-factor verification, a code will be sent to your mobile number. After entering the code, you can proceed.

## Part 3: Open your Twitter Archive

Once you have requested a Twitter archive, you will receive a mail saying that you can download your Twitter archive. At this point, you have two options to access your Twitter archive. Firstly, you can download the archive either from the link in the email or consider going through your Twitter account. To download the archive from Twitter directly, the steps are:

**Step 1:** Open your account and tap on "More." Select "Settings and Privacy" by clicking on it. Go to “Your Account” and select "Download an archive of your data." Provide a password and two-factor verification code if you have enabled it.

![initiate archive download process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/use-twitter-archive-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, you will see the option of "Download Archive." Click on this option and then tap to download the ZIP file on your computer.

**Step 4:** Inside the archive, there would be many files and folders such as “tweet\_media," which will contain all the photos and videos you have sent and uploaded from your account.
