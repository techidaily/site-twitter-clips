The person or even you now only have to tap the link, and it will directly open Twitter and take you to the exact tweet of that video.

## Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link

Well, you learned all the steps revolving around how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not have Twitter? Then what?

There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else. Still, you cannot embed it with the link.

There is an easy way to counter this problem if you wish to share Twitter Videos on WhatsApp directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on WhatsApp without any link. Just follow the steps below, and you will be all set.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Log in to your Twitter using your credentials.

![Log in to Twitter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-7.jpg)

## Step 2: Find the Video and Tap Share

Scroll through your Twitter feed and locate the video you want to share with your friends. Once you have finalized the video that you wish to share, tap the share icon right below the video.

## Step 2: Paste the Link

Copy and paste the link of the Twitter video you want to share in the dialogue box of the website. Once the link is pasted, it will automatically start the process and convert the video in a matter of seconds. The video will be ready to download.

![Paste the link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-11.jpg)

![Video is being downloaded](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-12.jpg)

## Step 3: Download the Video in the Desired Format

As soon as the conversion is completed, the website will show you the video preview and different options of sizes and video quality options to choose from. Various quality options are available, including 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality. The size of the download file varies with the quality. The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter.
