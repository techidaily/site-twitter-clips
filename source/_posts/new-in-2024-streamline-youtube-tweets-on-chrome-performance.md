1. #### Twitter Video Format

One of the most important aspects to consider while fixing this problem is checking if the video that is not being played has the correct format. Twitter only supports MP4 video format and A64 audio format. If any video on Twitter doesn't have such a format, it will not play. If only a few Twitter videos are not playing in Chrome but most of the videos are playing, this might be the problem with those videos. The best way o watch those videos is to download them using a third-party downloading platform.

1. #### Flash for Twitter

If you have checked the above aspect and it is not the case with your Twitter videos and non of the video is playing, you should try enabling the flash for Twitter. If the flash is not enabled in your Chrome browser, it will not play videos. To enable flash for Twitter, after visiting Twitter, click on the 'Lock' icon placed on the left side of the address bar and go to 'Site Settings.'

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix2.jpg)

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix3.png)

This will allow Twitter to use flash to play videos. If this was the reason behind the Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, allowing flash will solve this problem.

1. #### Clear Cookies and Cache
