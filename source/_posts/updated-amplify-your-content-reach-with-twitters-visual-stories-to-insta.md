## Share Twitter Video on Instagram Story

Instagram is a relatively more visual platform compared to Twitter, with an array of pictures and videos everywhere. This makes Instagram also more photo and video-friendly.

Now that you are familiar with all the benefits of cross-posting Twitter videos to Instagram, you can learn how to do that in quick and easy steps.

Instagram stories are also a very interactive feature that allow you to post content that will stay on your profile for just 24 hours and then get deleted automatically. You can post your Twitter video on Instagram stories if you don’t want to post the video permanently on your profile. Here is how you can post Twitter videos on Instagram stories:

### 1\. Share Twitter Videos on Instagram Story Chrome

While you always have the option of posting the Twitter video link on your Instagram story, this is not the same as posting as video. The link will lead them back to Twitter to watch the video, and people rarely open links to watch something. This means that you might have to post the actual video on your stories, and here is how you can do that.

If you are using chrome and your PC to access Twitter and Instagram, then open your browser.

* Open Twitter and login with your credentials.
* Locate the video from your Newsfeed. If you have retweeted the video, then you can find it under the media tab of your Profile.
