**Cache and Cookies of the Browser**

Twitter HD videos may not be played because of the cache data and cookies in your browser. You need to clear the cache of your application by clicking on Settings < Appa < Twitter < Clear Cache. You can also delete it from the browser if you are using Twitter on Chrome.

**Plugins’ Security Software**

So, you need to go to Apple Store or Play Store to download the latest version of Twitter or update the existing one. After updating, you can play the HD videos efficiently in the Twitter app.

**Launch Mobile Browser**
