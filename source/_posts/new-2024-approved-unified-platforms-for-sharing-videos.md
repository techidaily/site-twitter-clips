Tumblr is like other social platforms where you can share memes and other material; Tumblr is just aesthetically pleasing. The microblogging and social networking site are more like your online daily diary, but sadly, Tumblr is very underrated. It has a lot of cool yet hidden features. Some of the features of Tumblr are discussed below:

### Search Engine Optimization

Tumblr does Search Engine Optimization, from which it tells the consumers that it is search engine friendly. This SEO happens at the back end without any additional effort from the user part. As the SEO settings are done, you receive greater traffic to your **Tumblr Twitter video** post. This will eventually help you increase the interaction.

### Custom domain

Tumblr allows you to have a personalized domain. This might be any name that you want it to be. You can set your brand name as a domain; it will show that you are more professional than others. It doesn’t matter if you have selected another name for your domain; you can still host your website.

### Social Media Integration

Tumblr allows you to integrate with Facebook and Instagram; it can be configured from the user dashboard. You can do different settings for different types of posts; toggle on or off options are available as per consumer ease. Along with Facebook and Instagram, you can also share posts from Tumblr to Twitter and vice versa.

### Scheduled Posts

The **Tumblr Twitter video** that is created is not necessary to be posted. You can post them at a certain time or date. This can be done by the Schedule Post feature. You can add the post to the queue, which will automatically post it on a pre-determined schedule, or it can be saved as drafts. The post can also be set as Private and shared only with the members of the blog.
