## Step 3: Download the Video in the Desired Format

As soon as the conversion is completed, the website will show you the video preview and different options of sizes and video quality options to choose from. Various quality options are available, including 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality. The size of the download file varies with the quality. The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter.

![Different file sizes and quantities](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-13.jpg)

Choose the file size and quality that matches your requirements and click download. The file will download into your device's internal storage, and now you can easily share it.

## Step 4: Share it on WhatsApp

Now that the file is downloaded, all you have to do is open up WhatsApp, navigate to the chat of the person or group you wish to send the video to, and attach the video from the in-app file manager, or you can share it directly from your gallery.
