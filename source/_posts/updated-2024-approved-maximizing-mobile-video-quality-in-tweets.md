## Reasons Why Twitter HD Videos Not Playing

Sometimes, Twitter HD videos stop playing in the mobile application or in your browser. The reasons behind this happening have been enlisted below:

**Network Issue**

The issue of network connection is the major issue behind the improper functionality of the Twitter app. When the internet connection is slow, Twitter does not let you watch HD videos because they are high in quality and require fast speed internet connection.

You should also check the signal strength of your network from the connectivity settings. You can also switch towards another network that has strong signal strengths.

**Cache and Cookies of the Browser**

Twitter HD videos may not be played because of the cache data and cookies in your browser. You need to clear the cache of your application by clicking on Settings < Appa < Twitter < Clear Cache. You can also delete it from the browser if you are using Twitter on Chrome.

**Plugins’ Security Software**

Sometimes, the plugins’ security software and firewall options can hinder Twitter HD videos not to playing accurately and efficiently.

## How To Fix Twitter HD Videos Not Playing on iPhone/Android?

There are several solutions to deal with the situation when HD videos are not playing on your Android or iPhone. Some of these solutions have been enlisted below:

**Reinstall the Application**

You need to reinstall the Twitter app because the videos might not be being played due to some glitches in the app. So, it is recommended to uninstall it, then reinstall the app and play the videos again.

**Update Twitter App**

Sometimes, HD videos cannot be played on Twitter if you have not installed the latest version of Twitter on your iPhone or Android device. So, you need to go to Apple Store or Play Store to download the latest version of Twitter or update the existing one. After updating, you can play the HD videos efficiently in the Twitter app.
