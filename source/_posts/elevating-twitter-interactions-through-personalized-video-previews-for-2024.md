Twitter is a social media platform with a lot of content volume shared each day. People and pages compete for more likes, followers, comments, etc. The competition is basically to engage a more significant audience, and people tend to use different tactics.

Previously when you shared videos online, the cover was the video's starting. Still, with passing time and new options introduced, we have an option to add a thumbnail to our videos. A thumbnail is a cover photo that previews before the video is played.

In this article, you will be taught how to add a thumbnail to a Twitter video, change it and even enhance its looks.

## Add Thumbnail to Twitter Videos

If you are a regular uploader on Twitter and want to engage a larger audience, you need to have some nice features for your posts. For videos, the first thing has to be a thumbnail apart from the actual content.

To add thumbnails to your Twitter videos, follow the steps listed below.

### Step No 1: Choose a Thumbnail

Choose a thumbnail you want to be as the cover of your video. As these videos will likely be retweeted and seen by many people, make sure you have chosen the right thumbnail.

If you are wondering how to choose the right thumbnail or even design it, continue reading, and you will find it out down the line.

You can always capture a separate photo while filming the video or create a digital graphic while editing.

You can add simple graphics or photos and text that best describes your video's primary purpose or topic.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip no 3: Visible text

Make sure the text that you add to your thumbnail is appropriately visible. Its contrast is set such that the text does not blend in with the background but stands out from it. Hence, it is easily readable and does not create a light effect resulting in the audience skipping your video.

It is a part of the human psyche that they are naturally attracted to human faces more than any other graphic or image of any other object.

Be careful while choosing the color scheme of your photo; you can use a similar color palette as your video, or you can use colors in contrast to the theme of your video. It should not look alien in any way.

### Tip no 6: Editing and Color Scheme

Always edit and treat the thumbnail photo beforehand. It should be catchy and compliment the content of the video. Be careful while choosing the color scheme of your photo; you can use a similar color palette as your video, or you can use colors in contrast to the theme of your video. It should not look alien in any way.
