Each social media platform has its own flavor, and cross-posting has become exceptionally important, especially for bloggers and online businesses, to keep their audiences engaged.

Each platform also has its own audience, and you might have different people following you on each social media handle. However, even if each platform has its own vibe, it’s also true that content going viral on one platform will most likely be adored on the other platform as well.

This article will teach you how to share a Twitter video on Instagram and Instagram story. You can post on Twitter and Facebook together with one click and save a lot of time.

## Importance of Posting Across Multiple Platforms

Even while scrolling, if you come across an exciting video that you would like to post on your Instagram you can easily do that using one of the methods below. But, why would one want to post the same post on Twitter and then on Instagram?

### Reach a Wider Audience

Your friends on multiple platforms might not be the same, with each social media having its own style. Posting a video from Twitter to Instagram might reach an entirely different audience than Twitter with the varying algorithms. This will help reach a larger audience, and people can enjoy your content on any social media app.

### Social Media Strategy

Cross-posting is a very effective social media strategy that allows you to streamline your content and repurpose your content across all platforms. This will increase brand awareness and ensure people view your content and don’t miss out on it.

### Keeps Social Media Up to Date

Cross posting also helps in keeping all social media up to date. Anyone looking through your social media can see all the work you have done to date.

## Share Twitter Video on Instagram Story

Instagram is a relatively more visual platform compared to Twitter, with an array of pictures and videos everywhere. This makes Instagram also more photo and video-friendly.

Now that you are familiar with all the benefits of cross-posting Twitter videos to Instagram, you can learn how to do that in quick and easy steps.

Instagram stories are also a very interactive feature that allow you to post content that will stay on your profile for just 24 hours and then get deleted automatically. You can post your Twitter video on Instagram stories if you don’t want to post the video permanently on your profile. Here is how you can post Twitter videos on Instagram stories:

### 1\. Share Twitter Videos on Instagram Story Chrome

While you always have the option of posting the Twitter video link on your Instagram story, this is not the same as posting as video. The link will lead them back to Twitter to watch the video, and people rarely open links to watch something. This means that you might have to post the actual video on your stories, and here is how you can do that.

If you are using chrome and your PC to access Twitter and Instagram, then open your browser.

* Open Twitter and login with your credentials.
* Locate the video from your Newsfeed. If you have retweeted the video, then you can find it under the media tab of your Profile.

![twitter videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-video-on-instagram-1.png)

* Once you locate the video, right-click on the video, and from the menu, select “Copy Video Address”. This will copy the video URL to the PC’s clipboard.
* You need to download the video with a video downloading website like [Twitter Video Downloader](https://twittervideodownloader.com/).
* Open Twitter video Downloader in a New Tab.
* Now, paste the copied video URL into the URL box on the top of the screen.
