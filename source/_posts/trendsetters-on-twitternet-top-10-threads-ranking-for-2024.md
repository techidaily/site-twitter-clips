The video is drawing attention after she has been pointed out as a 'plant' by the public. The video is titled “Best moments of Brunna." However, she’s doing nothing special in the video. The video shows moments of her doing nothing or being silent.

### 4\. A meme-based reaction on Tom Brady's retirement

This video is posted on Pardon My Take’s official Twitter account. Pardon My Take or PMT is a comedic sports podcast by Barstool Sports.
