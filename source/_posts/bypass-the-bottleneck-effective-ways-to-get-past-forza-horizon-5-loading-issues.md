## Forza Horizon 5 Loading Woes? Here Are 7 Effective Workarounds

## Fixes for Forza Horizon 5 Stuck on Loading Screen

2. [Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Repair common disk issues](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Use a VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Run in clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Reinstall the Forza 5](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
7. [Update Windows to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Before you set out to try the fixes below, please check on the **game server status**  first. Because if the Forza Horizon 5 is in the middle of server maintenance, you won’t be able to load into the game. For your Forza Horizon 5 server maintenance information, head to[**Forza Support Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/forza%5Fsupport) .

## Fix 1 Check your internet connection

 The Discord streams not loading issue could simply be a connection problem. Having a quick and simple check on your network connection should be your first fix to try.

1. **Reboot your network** . Simply unplug your modem and router from their power supply. Wait for a minute to let them cool off and then plug them back to their power supply. This can help with better network connectivity by refreshing the RAM and renewing the IP address.

2. **Try using a LAN cable** instead if you’re using **Wi-Fi**  connection**.**  Convenient as it is, yet most of the time **Wi-Fi**  is not stable enough for computer games. A wired connection would be a better option for your network stability.

 If network connection is not where the problem is, try the next method below.

## Fix 2 Update your graphics driver

 Outdated or corrupt drivers are the common reason for game crashing. Most game crashing errors can be fixed by **updating your graphics driver** . What’s more, the latest driver can improve your gaming experience. You can head to graphics manufacturers’ websites (like **[Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)**  or **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)** ) to download the latest drivers. However, if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

 Or, you can click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the **correct version** of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version). ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/de-uodate-all.jpg)
