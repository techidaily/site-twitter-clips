Fake and inactive accounts can limit your ability to connect with Twitter users that actually want to comment, share or like the content you post on this social media network. The number of the accounts you can follow on Twitter can be larger than the number of followers you have on your account by approximately 2000 accounts. For that reason, unfollowing accounts that don't post often or share low-quality content is necessary in order to free up space for new people who are actually interested in what you have to say and offer.

Finding which Twitter accounts you should unfollow is just one out of many powerful tools the Manage Flitter offers. You can access the analytics features, schedule tweets for different time zones or manage two or more Twitter accounts with this tool. The free version lets you clean up your account on Twitter, but if you would like to use the advanced tools Manage Flitter provides, you will have to purchase the Pro version that costs $12 per month or the Business version that costs $49 per month.

#### 5\. Unfollower Stats

The Unfollower Stats tool is remarkably easy to use and it enables you to track fake accounts or people who don't follow you back. You just have to log in to your Twitter account and let the Unfollower Stats collect the information about the accounts you should unfollow. In addition, this tool enables you to track daily changes on the unfollower list. The Unfollower Stats is free to use, although you first have to sign in before you can start cleaning up your Twitter account.

#### 6\. Tweepi

Discovering inactive Twitter accounts and removing them from the list of accounts you are following is easy with Tweepi. This web-based social media tool also enables you to locate users who are likely to follow you and engage with posts you share on Twitter. You can either choose the Platinum or Silver packages that offer slightly different features, but ensure that your Twitter account is poised for success.

#### 7\. Statusbrew

This powerful social media management tool enables you to manage your Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn accounts from one place. Statsbrew makes responding to comments and mentions quick and easy, while also enabling you to tailor your own social media audience. Increase the efficiency of your social media posts, and remove all inactive followers from your account in just a few simple clicks. There is no free version of this tool and pricing plans start at $25 per month.
