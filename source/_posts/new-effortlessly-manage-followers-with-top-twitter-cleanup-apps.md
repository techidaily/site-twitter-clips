Fake and inactive accounts can limit your ability to connect with Twitter users that actually want to comment, share or like the content you post on this social media network. The number of the accounts you can follow on Twitter can be larger than the number of followers you have on your account by approximately 2000 accounts. For that reason, unfollowing accounts that don't post often or share low-quality content is necessary in order to free up space for new people who are actually interested in what you have to say and offer.

Note: The following 7 apps are not in a particular order.

## 7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter

Apps featured below offer a wide array of options, so we recommend to choose the one that best fits your demands since there is no point in purchasing an app if you are going to use just a fraction of its full potential.

#### 1\. SocialOopmph

SocialOomph is much more than just a simple unfollow tool because it enables its users to schedule tweets, track hashtags or manage multiple Twitter accounts. The free version of the tool is available, but it offers a limited amount of options. In order to unlock all of the app's features, you must purchase its professional version that costs $17, 97.

#### 2\. CrowdFire

#### 3\. Who Unfollowed Me

![who unfollowed me](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-followed-me.png)
